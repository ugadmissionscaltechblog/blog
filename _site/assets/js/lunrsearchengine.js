    "title": "An Interview with a JPL Mentor!",
    "body": "2021/03/12 - Over the past several months, I have had the opportunity to intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) under the mentorship of senior research technologist Dr. Xiaoqing Pi. Dr. Pi’s guidance and mentorship has been instrumental to the development and success of my internship at JPL, where I use machine-learning to enhance the accuracy and integrity of navigation and communication signals. In addition to helping me develop an understanding of atmospheric and ionospheric remote sensing and machine-learning, Dr. Pi has often offered his insights on how to improve my researching skills. Dr. Pi was generous enough to take the time to answer a few questions regarding his research and advice for future student interns. I believe many students can benefit from some of the lessons that he has taught me: Q: What does your research consist of?: Dr. Xiaoqing Pi: “I have been conducting research on space physics, and remote sensing and modeling of the Earth’s ionosphere. Space physics is a science discipline about physics and systematic interactions between solar wind, interplanetary magnetic field, Earth’s magnetic field, magnetosphere, ionosphere, and thermosphere. The same principles apply to the Sun and other planets, and to other stars and their planets. The ionosphere is the ionized portion of the upper atmosphere at altitudes between about 100 to 1000 kilometers (the layer above 1000 km is called the plasmasphere). It is created by photoionization of the upper atmosphere due to solar EUV radiation. The density, temperature, and velocity of ionospheric charged particles (ions and electrons, or we also call them plasma) vary with solar EUV radiation intensity, the radiation optical path in the atmosphere, atmospheric constituents, and ionospheric dynamics. The ionosphere affects radio signals in ways to delay signals, and sometimes causes random fluctuations in signals, which are called ionospheric scintillation. This occurs if the signals pass through regions of irregularly distributed electron densities or ionospheric irregularities. The signal delay and scintillation effects have an impact on technology systems that rely on radio signals at HF through L-band. Examples include short wave radios, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, including GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and Galileo), satellite-based Earth remote sensing radars, etc. Research on space physics helps to advance our understanding of mechanisms of ionospheric variations and disturbances. Development of remote sensing techniques and models helps to augment our observation capability and to enhance the reliability and accuracy of the technology systems”. Q: What do you enjoy the most about your field of study?: Dr. Xiaoqing Pi: “What I enjoy the most about my work is that I can pursue scientific discoveries and also conduct development to enhance technology systems. In my study field, I have had chances to conduct research and develop techniques to support satellite-based augmentation system (the Wide Area Augmentation System – WAAS as an example, which is the U. S. system to augment GNSS for aviation navigation), satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radars, ocean altimeters, deep space navigation, etc”. Q: What are some projects you are currently working on: Dr. Xiaoqing Pi: “I am currently conducting several research projects. One of them is to develop techniques to detect, measure, and remove ionospheric effects globally in satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar imagery. This research supports the upcoming NASA-ISRO SAR mission (NISAR). Another is to analyze scintillation effects on GNSS signals and to develop capability of predicting ionospheric irregularities and scintillation. This research supports the U. S. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS). I am also further extending a Global Assimilative Ionospheric Model (GAIM) to estimate ionospheric conditions under which ionospheric irregularities can be triggered. This is a research project under NASA’s Science Mission Directorate Living With a Star (LWS) program”. Q: How has your experience been with interns? What do you enjoy about being a mentor?: Dr. Xiaoqing Pi: “I have had chances to work with several interns in the past, right now, and in the coming summer at either undergraduate or graduate level. These interns are very excited and enthusiastic about the research projects that they get into. Although the research fields are fresh to them, they are all eager to learn the phenomena, physical processes, and technology, and to contribute to the projects. As their mentor, I am happy to see that they are very motivated to face challenges and pursue solutions in order to reach the research goals”. Q: What advice do you have for current undergraduates regarding research and internships?: Dr. Xiaoqing Pi: “Undergraduate students should not shy away from challenging projects and tasks. They should prepare themselves with required basic skills and by reading relevant references about the research fields. They should follow their mentor’s advice, and actively look for solutions when encountering problems. Take my current research that recruits undergraduate interns through SURF, as an example, the research involves machine learning techniques and Python software. The interested students should be familiar with Python programming skills and familiar with Python-based machine learning libraries as well as their various applications. In addition, students should be prepared to process a large amount of data using Python programs. Different projects require different skills. Interested students may follow mentors’ guidance and suggestions”. Q: Why should students apply for and/or participate in NASA internships?: Dr. Xiaoqing Pi: “NASA’s research projects are of frontier research. Your mentors are often the front runners of the fields. Being an intern at a NASA center, you will surely learn exciting space science and cutting-edge technologies. Take my current research as an example, one of the major challenges in NASA’s Heliophysics Division research programs is to predict occurrence and intensity of ionospheric irregularities. The irregularities can cause scintillation in trans-ionospheric radio signals, which fades signal power and degrades signal quality. The occurrence and intensity of ionospheric irregularities involve complicated coupling processes between ionized and neutral gas in the upper atmosphere, including their dynamics controlled by the geomagnetic field and impact of solar wind perturbations on the ionosphere and thermosphere. Prediction of the irregularities is needed in certain technology applications, such as satellite-based aviation navigation and radio communications in military operations, as examples. This is an area where machine learning may play a role to solve the problem”. Q:  What are some qualities you look for when selecting an intern?: Dr. Xiaoqing Pi: “When selecting interns, I look for their enthusiasm about the project, preparedness of the required skills and knowledge about the field, eagerness of learning, good communications, active pursuit of solutions, and team work spirit. In terms of knowledge, one of my research projects requires knowledge of machine learning and its applications, as well as software tools that can be used for machine learning projects. There are some good machine learning libraries written in Python so that Python programming skills are very helpful. In addition, when conducting a specific machine learning task, a large amount of historical data sets is required. With Python programming skills, students can write programs to organize, process and analyze the data and outcome”. "

    "body": "2021/01/26 - The transition period to remote learning was a very uncertain time, especially for research and the Caltech Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program. Many hands-on projects had to pivot at the last minute to facilitate off-campus contributions. However, many Techers were able to take advantage of the research opportunities offered at Caltech and JPL to make the best out of remote learning and research. To paint a picture, I’ve interviewed a few talented Techers for some insight on what researching from home looks like for them. Q: What does your research consist of?: Tyrone McNichols, ‘23, CS/Math: “I work for the Processors System Development Group at JPL. My work involves developing software for radio astronomy, in particular for NASA’s Deep Space Network”. Kristina Stoyanova, ‘23, CS: “At the Ron Weiss Mammalian Cell Biology Lab at MIT, I use convolutional neural networks to predict regions of epigenetic marks on DNA sequences. One application of this is to help biologists computationally identify non-functional regions of new genes they’ve created before they even put the DNA into a host organism! The intention is to reduce the trial and error process of research”. Anna Li, ‘23, Chemistry: “I work on doing molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics calculations on the oxygen evolving complex in Photosystem II as a joint project between the Fischer and Goddard labs. We are working on exploring the mechanisms of photoassembly of the metal cluster, as well as the mechanisms during oxygen evolution”. Q: What does researching from home look like for you?: Tyrone McNichols, ‘23, CS/Math: “Mostly remote programming and testing. I also go to a few webex meetings for my group”. Kristina Stoyanova, ‘23, CS: “Reading papers, planning architectures for the models, and debugging code”. Anna Li, ‘23, Chemistry: “Well it just looks like me dinking around on my computer in one of Caltech’s clusters”.  Q: How do you stay connected? What programs facilitate your online research?: Tyrone McNichols, ‘23, CS/Math: “JPL has a slack for employees, and another one specifically for interns which helps a lot. I’m also a part of some employee groups at JPL”. Kristina Stoyanova, ‘23, CS: “My graduate student mentor Sebastian Palacios, Prof. Ron Weiss, and I have a Slack channel, and we Zoom every week to go over my project’s state”. Anna Li, ‘23, Chemistry: “I meet with my mentors every week or every other week to go over results. I use NAMD/LAAMPS for molecular dynamics and Jaguar for quantum mechanics”. Q: Any advice for anyone who is or will be researching from home?: Tyrone McNichols, ‘23, CS/Math: “Make sure you’ve got a consistent work schedule. It’s really easy to get off track online, but separating your life into times when you’re doing work and when you’re not can help a lot”. Kristina Stoyanova, ‘23, CS: “Even if you want to do laboratory work there is so much prep work (reading papers, training, designing plans for experiments, reading more papers) that could help you hit the ground running once we get back in the lab. Even computational projects can later be verified experimentally. I wish everyone the best of luck with their research!” Anna Li, ‘23, Chemistry: “Don’t let research become too much stress, classes always come first”. Similar to my peers, my experience, conducting research at JPL remotely, hasn’t been much different from distance learning, structure wise. Luckily, the project I’m involved in is heavily computational, so I am still able to conduct research and contribute to the project remotely. However, just because my internship is online does not mean that the standards at which I need to perform have diminished. It does take a lot of planning and time management to ensure that I stay on track and to reach my research goal in a timely manner. My mentor and I Zoom regularly to discuss updates and results and we share all our work via cloud to make things more accessible. Additionally, my lab has weekly meetings to explore the different research being conducted by members in the lab and catch up with one another. JPL has also been doing a great job at finding creative ways to ensure that interns can continue to learn, conduct research, and feel included. For example, there are multiple informational events and seminars held virtually every week. Although it’s not ideal to work remotely, and I would have preferred to be on site, obviously no one can control the pandemic. Remote research has been a great learning experience nonetheless and I am thankful for the growth opportunities it’s provided, not only for me but for many other Caltech students as well. "

    "title": "Rotation Rotation Rotation - The Caltech Houses",
    "body": "2020/12/20 - My favorite part about Caltech is the Houses! The easiest way to describe them is as Hogwarts houses: each has their own personality and group of people and the first thing you do at Caltech is go through a “sorting” process. The people are what makes the Houses at Caltech so great. As a frosh, it’s amazing to be able to come in and immediately have a group of 100+ people to support you. Because the Houses have students from every grade, you make friends with upperclassmen and can ask for help on tons of things like:  Hints on difficult problem sets Advice on which classes to take How to email Professors and find SURFs What days you should steer clear of House dinners (mystery fish should remain a mystery) How to find internships and jobs or apply to grad school The best restaurants in the Pasadena area That one time frosh year you broke your ankle and needed to be driven to physical therapy 3 times a week (thanks Dylan &lt;3)Plus the houses also put on tons of social events from a ski trip, beach trip, movie nights, picnics, and tons of secret events you’ll learn about when you join one! Now I hope your immediate response is: “How do I join these great houses?” This happens through Rotation. Rotation is 2 weeks of House dinners and events so that the prefrosh can get to know all the House cultures. In addition to a dinner and dessert in each House, there are tons of other events from Open Mic Night, Capture the Flag, Grill Night, a House-run Boba Lounge, and many more! Besides getting to know the Houses, all the events are a ton of fun, are a great way to meet other frosh, and almost every single one has food. At the end of the 2 weeks of Rotation, you rank the Houses in order of your preference and all the rankings are then fed into an algorithm to match frosh with Houses. Then, the Fleming cannon is fired, all the frosh find out what House they’re in, and they then get rushed off for a night of welcome activities. As Lloyd House President I had a lot of fun helping to run Rotation and know all the hard work the students put into making it a fun experience for everyone. This year, Rotation has been pushed off to the beginning of Winter term and will be done virtually. With all the time the students are putting into making this new format work, I’m sure it’ll be a great success! "

    "title": "The Indian Festival of Lights",
    "body": "2020/12/19 - Hey everyone, and happy holidays! Personally, one of my favorite holidays during the season is Diwali. The description you’ll find all over the internet is “Diwali is the Indian Festival of Lights. ” This is pretty much what every Diwali-celebrating, South-Asian child in America wrote in their elementary school reports about family traditions during the holidays, but it holds true! Diwali usually does involve lighting candles and sparklers, and generally celebrates the triumph of good over evil in various mythologies. I like to think of it as a time of general goodwill and festivity. In non-pandemic times, Diwali celebrations might include with boisterous parties with tons of people and desserts and music. Last year, a couple of my friends and I organized an event in Ruddock House for people to come celebrate, complete with sweets and sparklers! However, the 2020 version, like for most things, has had to be toned down. We got together over Zoom instead, and although it couldn’t fully match the vibe of being in person, the spirit was definitely there. And, it’s nice to think that we’ve started a yearly tradition. The festivity (and Bollywood music) also makes me miss Dhamaka, the Bollywood dance team we have on campus. I joined Dhamaka during my freshman year: it all started out as me tagging along with friends who had pushed me to go with them to the first practice. I was pretty apprehensive because I had never really been on an official dance team before, or ever danced on a stage for that matter, but the group was incredibly welcoming! It didn’t matter that I didn’t have previous experience (as is the case for many clubs on campus!), and it was a fun outlet for me to take a break from sets every weekend. We would meet every week or so to practice for the Caltech Dance Show, held in the spring every year, where we were the big finale! Check us out on YouTube:   Earlier this year, Dhamaka also paired with OASIS (Organization of the Associated Students of the Indian Subcontinent), a grad student-led cultural club on campus, to put on a Holi event! Holi is another festival celebrated in India, during which people welcome the season of spring with lots of color. I celebrated Holi with family and friends every year without fail before coming to Caltech, so it was rewarding to be able to share the experience with my college friends for the first time.  I also performed at this event with Dhamaka right before everyone had to leave campus in March. I suppose it was sort of our last hurrah for the year, but I’m looking forward to continuing all these traditions and events next year and am glad to be part of a community that is full of culture! "

    "title": "Reflecting on College Admissions",
    "body": "2020/12/17 - What do you remember feeling when you found out you had been accepted to Caltech?: In short: I was completely shocked. Caltech had been my first-choice school for years (warm weather, great science, what’s not to love?). However, I didn’t ever think I’d get in: nobody had gotten in from my high school in the living memory of any teacher and my guidance counselor had told me point blank that it was a longshot. So, the scene: December 15, 2016. A cold, chilly day in Denver, Colorado. I’m wearing a sports coat and khaki pants. Why? Well, I was in the literal middle of an interview with Duke when I got the email push notification saying that there was an update to my admissions portal. To this day I have absolutely no idea how I finished that interview. But once I got out of eyesight, I immediately opened my phone and clicked on the link expecting to find disappointment. I was amazed to be greeted with confetti instead – so much so that I did a jump and punched the air, much to the confusion of the few people walking on the street beside me. How did you decide to attend Caltech?: For me, it came down 100% to academics. When I visited Caltech on a tour, one of the fencing team members had told me that Caltech Geological and Planetary Sciences was objectively and subjectively the best undergraduate program in the world. And honestly that’s true. It’s a 2:1 faculty to student ratio, and we get a trip to Hawaii senior year (although maybe not this year).  What really sold it was the interactions I had on my visit to campus. One of the professors, Paul Asimow, spent an hour showing me every geosciences lab and talking about the research. It’s this connection that immediately made me realize the potential of Caltech. A tenured faculty member was taking time to interact with me, a student who hadn’t even committed yet. I’ll talk about this more in another post, but I really didn’t relate to any of the students I met (although I’ve since met great people on campus). But when I committed, I was willing to completely sacrifice my social life for four years to get that student-faculty relationship. What do you wish you could go back and tell yourself senior year of high school?: I would’ve told myself to relax a bit. Have fun. Enjoy the people I was around and the memories I was making. I haven’t really interacted with a lot of people from high school since graduating. Most of them have stayed in-state with the same friend groups they’ve always had. I think one thing I didn’t really do is appreciate those connections enough in the moment. High school isn’t really a fun time, and we all suffered through that together. I wish I’d spent more time with those people and really just cherished that bond – I didn’t really realize how special that was until it was gone. What advice would you give to the admitted Class of 2025?: I’m going to spin this out in a separate post, but in short, it’s this: take the time to know every school you get accepted to. Make sure that above parental influence, external pressure, or scary posts on Quora, you make the best choice for yourself. Whether that’s Caltech or anywhere else. Our school isn’t right for everyone. But if you were admitted, our admissions team believes that it’s right for you. – Chandrew "

    "body": "2020/12/17 - It’s crazy to think that it has been four years now since I was applying to college. I remember it vividly. This week we’re spending some time reflecting on our personal admissions processes, and how we ended up at Caltech. There’s one question though that I wanted to spin out into a separate post: “what advice would you give to the admitted class of 2025?” And I think the best way to do this is to tell a more detailed story than I did in my other post. I almost didn’t come to Caltech. I was extremely fortunate during college admissions: I got into 6/7 schools I applied to, all them very competitive schools. My decision came down to this: Caltech, a half tuition scholarship at one school (13% acceptance), tiny scholarship at another school (9% acceptance). Honestly, it really came down to Caltech and the last school – their admissions officer had handwritten me a note about my application with specific comments on my essay, and honestly, I just felt wanted there. Caltech was objectively the better school academically (especially in the geosciences), but I really did not connect with the people when I visited. In-fact, I actually really didn’t like a single person I met while touring Caltech. Because of the house system on campus people with certain hobbies/interests often group together at Tech and during my Caltech in a day experience I didn’t interact with a single person from the house I ended up in, or any of the houses that I share interests with. What it came down to was this: I was going to go out to participate in the other school’s weekend event, but it conflicted with the FIRST Robotics World Championships, so I didn’t go. I know for a fact that if I had gone to that school’s weekend event that I would not have attended Caltech, and that that would have likely been the biggest mistake of my life. In this particular circumstance, fate, or perhaps the butterfly effect, intervened and led to me committing to Caltech. So, here’s my conclusion. My advice for you, whether it’s at Caltech, or any school you go to, is to make sure you know the complete picture before deciding. Know the school, make the time to visit (perhaps virtually this year), and meet some students. That way, no matter what you end up picking, you’ll know that you’ve made the best choice for you and for your future. I’ll be honest, Caltech is not easy. I’ve been working harder and had much less fun than most of my other friends in college. And I’d do it all again. – Chandrew "

    "body": "2020/12/16 - What do you remember feeling when you found out you had been accepted to Caltech?: I remember the exact moments I got into Caltech. I was backstage at a dance recital, I had my hair and makeup done, I was in costume and about 20 minutes away from going on stage to perform. I had to quickly run upstairs to forward my mom the email link with the recital tickets since there was no signal backstage. After I forwarded her the email, I noticed an email from Caltech with a subject line of “View your Caltech admissions decision online. ” To be perfectly honest, I thought there was no way I would get in. I had resolved myself to opening the rejection and moving on with my day. I logged into my account and opened the letter. Confetti flew across my screen as I read the words “Congratulations!” I screamed in excitement and ran backstage. I screamed at my best friend Mary: “I GOT INTO CALTECH!” I was beyond excited and frankly completely in shock. Tears of joy filled my eyes, and it took all the self-control in the world to not completely ruin my stage makeup. I went on stage about 5 minutes later and the show was a disaster. I forgot all the choreography and was consistently a beat behind the other dancers, but that still did not put a damper on my mood. I was simply too ecstatic to even care. How did you decide to attend Caltech?: Honestly, Caltech was the best school I got into so the decision was not difficult. I was concerned that I would not fit in because I expected everyone to be the same “cookie-cutter” nerd that wanted to study 24/7. While I love science, I also wanted to have a social life in college, make friends, and have interests beyond academics. After visiting campus, I realized, yes, everyone is a huge science nerd (in the best possible way). But, everyone had their own passions and interests that they wanted to pursue. The experience made me realize Caltech is more than just “an academically rigorous” university, it is also a community that I would find my place in. I expected everyone at Caltech to be the same person: a workaholic science geek that only wanted to study and do research all the time. This intimidated me because I also wanted to find friends and have a social life outside of school. I visited Caltech and talked to current students to see if Caltech was the right fit. After my visit, I realized Caltech is full of diverse personalities and interests and I would be able to find my people. What do you wish you could go back and tell yourself senior year of high school?: I would tell myself to learn more basic life skills -namely, personal finance, organization, time management, and cooking. Although I am pretty good at these things now, I think my life in college would have been easier if I learned these things during high school instead. What advice would you give to the admitted Class of 2025?: Caltech is full of resources and it is important to take advantage of them. However, take other people’s advice with a grain of salt. You must decide what YOU want out of life and out of college. For example, upperclassmen are a great resource. They can tell you if your course load is too ambitious, or which classes are fun to take, etc. But at the end of the day, you know yourself the best. When I was a freshman, I gave too much credence to upperclassmen opinions. I decided to try out computer science because so many people advocated for the major and the career. However, I knew that I was more passionate about biology and chemistry. Now, I am a Premed pursuing a chemistry degree. "

    "body": "2020/12/16 - It’s a familiar story told by a select few. I anticipated the first line to read, “We regret to inform you. ” Instead, orange and silver confetti fluttered across my laptop screen. My acceptance filled me with joy and disbelief. After telling the good news to friends, family, and mentors, I realized how much I sacrificed for this outcome. The sum of all my opportunity costs–the weekends preparing for science competitions, late nights crossing fruit flies, and weeks tweaking my essays instead of having more typical teenage adventures–cashed in at this one point in time. My high school experience could’ve been different, but I don’t regret my choices. I had so much fun learning and researching that I wanted to, in earnest, do more of that in college. Years spent scaling the stucco wall left little time to imagine what’s on the other side. Maybe it’s a form of self-protection, but during the application process I didn’t think much about what it meant to “be a Caltech student. ” The fear of getting my hopes up came second to the fear of losing myself in prestigiousness. As cheesy as it sounds, when I did dream of what I’d do in college, I imagined dramatically scribbling equations on blackboards or commanding a fleet of drones from my dorm room. I didn’t need to go to Caltech to do those things, but it would be the best place where I could. Over the wall, I wondered if I should commit. I’d likely lose touch with my friends and family. Unsure of my future, I looked to the past for guidance–to the 19th-century pioneers headed west in search of gold. With a clear purpose, they were able to survive the arduous journey. They shouldered being lost, sick, and ambushed in the hope their efforts would pay off someday. Similar in spirit and destination, I decided to attend Caltech because my mission has remained singular: I want to learn science and engineering from the best in the world. Visiting Caltech gave me greater confidence in my decision. Its sunkissed campus, unparalleled research, and tight-knit community captivated me. Although Tech has been unforgiving at times, it has kept its promise in supporting my mission. In my first year, I saw the fly brain glow in response to an odor. I watched Einstein’s equations of special relativity leap out from Maxwell’s equations. I expressed the closed-form of the Fibonacci sequence using the golden ratio. Having completed two years, I have my short stack of shiny ingots. There is still so much to discover. To those starting this journey, I offer you the same golden nugget I found in Feynman’s Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track: Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent, and original manner possible.

    "body": "2020/11/29 - When the announcement was first made that fall term was going to be online, I started talking to friends and looking for places to live. We were debating locations around the country: California, Florida, New York, etc. . there were plenty of options. Then it suddenly hit me, what is stopping us from going to Hawaii, covid numbers were better and a two week quarentine would ensure that numbers stayed down… I proposed this to my friend and we agreed it would be an amazing experience, but we didn’t want to get out hopes up. A month or so later we still haven’t decided where to live, Hawaii seemed too far and too difficult to plan. But we couldn’t get the idea out of our heads. We spent some time looking into plane tickets, places to stay, etc… and it actually didn’t seem so impossible after all. A couple weeks later and we were arriving here on the big island! So online school is of course not really on Mars, but I thought that picture looked a lot like it! That photo is actually from the world’s tallest mountain: Mauna Kea. Yes, Mauna Kea is the world’s tallest mountain, Everest is the world’s highest mountain. Everest is 29032 feet above sea level while Mauna Kea is only 13803 feet above sea level, however Mauna Kea from bottom to peak is over 32800 feet tall (compared to Everest’s 29000 feet from bottom to peak). With school being online, a couple of my friends and I packed our bags and moved to Hawaii for fall term! We have: Explored caves created by flowing lava! Seen some pretty amazing waterfalls! Swam with huge (8 foot+) manta rays! And more! Overall, I have had an amazing experience here in Hawaii. While I miss Caltech dearly, this opportunity to go explore Hawaii with my friends is an unforgettable and amazing experience! Overall, the decision to come to Hawaii was a very sudden and spur of the moment choice, something I usually don’t do! Yet this has become one of the most amazing experiences of my life! Have you experienced any “good accidents”? Let me know in the comments! "

    "body": "2020/11/27 - Have you ever gotten lost trying to find an address? Have you ever been annoyed by the voice on your phone telling you to “Turn left in 100 ft. ” when in reality there is no street to turn into? When you find an address using your phone, have you ever wondered where that information comes from? I think we all have. GPS (Global Positioning System) is a system composed of a fleet of about 24 satellites put into orbit and maintained by the U. S. Department of defense. This technology is used to find a position on Earth by using a mathematical technique, called trilateration. Trilateration uses about 3 satellites, at any given time, to determine an object’s speed, elevation, and position. Most electronic devices come with a built-in GPS chip and use Wi-Fi networks and cellphone towers to enhance location accuracy and calculate its position. Even though GPS is a highly sophisticated system, it is far from perfect! It is not uncommon for it to malfunction when a navigator cannot receive sufficient satellite data or when signals move too slowly due to atmospheric irregularities in the troposphere and ionosphere. This, in turn, can output inaccuracies in location calculations which can cause serious problems in navigation and aviation in addition to unnecessary stress and frustration.  There are multiple ways to refine GPS functionality. One of these ways is to improve its accuracy. Over the last several months, I have been conducting research at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), under the mentorship of JPL senior research technologist Dr. Xiaoqing Pi. Our research involves using machine-learning to increase the integrity of navigation and communication signals. More specifically, we work on studying and predicting ionospheric irregularities triggered by geomagnetic storms, plasma convection, and associate dynamics in the high-latitude ionosphere. Our goal is to reduce signal reception interruptions, caused by solar activity such as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. We aim to increase the accuracy of technology applications that rely on the Global Navigation Satellite System and GPS data. My individual contributions include developing and applying Python-based machine learning to improve navigation and communication signal integrity. I am responsible for downloading, analyzing, and processing various sets of GPS and magnetometer data using Python programs, which I write from scratch. Once the data is pre-processed, I run it through several machine-learning algorithms that I’ve developed, to predict the time, location, and intensity of these ionospheric irregularities. After the predictions are generated, I analyze their accuracy by calculating their correlations against historical data. The goal is for these algorithms, once implemented, to accurately predict ionospheric irregularities, under various geophysical and space weather conditions, in real time, reducing the impact of ionospheric scintillation on receptions of GNSS signals and data; thus improving navigation systems. As this research continues to evolve and the accuracy of these predictions increases, GPS malfunctions could potentially be a problem of the past! Devices and technology could be engineered to take the above predictions into account and adapt their outputs accordingly, making them more accurate and reliable. Hopefully, next time you use GPS to find directions to the nearest boba shop, you’ll get there on a timely manner and without getting lost! "

    "title": "How do you manage sports and Caltech?",
    "body": "2020/11/17 - Usually, while writing this post, I would be at Caltech playing volleyball. I begin school eith preseason, which for those unfamiliar (or are planning on joining women’s volleyball, women’s soccer, men’s soccer, men’s waterpolo, or cross country) is a 5 week long period before school begins where the sports teams I listed before practice and compete. My life during preseason is basically volleyball 24/7. Two practices a day (during school only one) and game days three days a week. No school work to worry about, spending time with my teammates all day, a nice refresher before school begins.  I write this post dearly missing volleyball, but I am not going to sit here and complain about how I wish I could be on the court. Instead, I am going to answer the most common question I get from protofrosh! How do you balance time between sports and Caltech? I’ll start off with a fact, the average GPA of Caltech student-athletes is higher than the average GPA of non-student athletes. I hope that makes you potential student-athletes feel a little bit better! During season, you do have less free time than outside season. I like to think of it as I am spending my free time playing volleyball. You do get pretty good at managing time. Some days there are long bus rides to away games, so you have to decide: am I going to work on the bus, will I work when I get back to campus, or will I have started before leaving campus? I personally like to do work on the bus, but plenty of people don’t. You also have access to all the upperclassmen teammates who may have taken the classes you are in or are in some of the same classes as your teammates. Your teammates are happy to help! You really learn to make the most of your time when balancing school and a sport. Another important thing to note is the 2 hour period from 4-6 PM where professors can’t schedule class, TAs can’t have office hours, etc. Practice will be in this two hour time period so you don’t have to worry about missing class. You may have to miss a couple of classes for games, but I have found professors are always understanding and I have never been penalized for missing class due to a game. Overall I love playing volleyball for Caltech and think sports are not only good for keeping you in shape, but also good for the mind. On days where you have been busy with work, or are stressed, although practice may not sound the most appealing, taking those two hours to exercise and be with your team, I have found, always vastly improves my mood. Go beavers! "

    "title": "Applying for a Caltech SURF!",
    "body": "2020/10/30 - The research opportunities, offered to all students at Caltech, are second to none! There are many labs on campus, and I am constantly amazed by the ground-breaking research being conducted by professors, graduates, and undergraduates in each of these labs on a daily basis. The best part is that Caltech undergraduates have the opportunity to apply for and obtain internships in many of these labs. They get to participate and be an integral part of ingenious research. From what I’ve heard, this is not the case in other undergraduate programs. Students elsewhere are usually not given such tremendous opportunities and respect, especially so early in their college career. Instead, they are usually tasked with cleaning beakers or secretarial work; not getting the opportunity to apply what they’ve learned in class to study a discipline they’re passionate about, firsthand. One of Caltech’s Crown Jewels is its Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) Program. This program, established in 1979, grants students the tremendous opportunity to conduct groundbreaking research in a field of their interest alongside field leaders who act as their mentors. The SURF process models a grant-seeking approach which allows students to gain experience writing project proposals, composing technical papers, and delivering presentations. These 10-week-long paid positions are taken advantage of, every summer, by the majority of Caltech undergraduates. Given the size of the student body, and Caltech’s 3:1 student-faculty ratio, the chances of landing a SURF over the summer are substantial if students are willing to take the initiative and apply for one. In fact, many of these research projects carry on into the school year. To obtain a SURF you need to first find and contact a Principal Investigator (PI), researcher, or graduate student in a lab conducting research you’re interested in. Students can choose from the plethora of labs on campus or research projects at other facilities and universities. When selecting a mentor, it is important to consider the research and your collaborative compatibility with the lab and potential mentor. For instance, sophomore, Elsa Palumbo, studying Astrophysics, kept this in mind when searching for her mentor. Last year, Elsa secured a SURF in the NEWTS (NEarby Worlds and Their Stars) Lab with Dr. Benjamin Montet, a Caltech alum who teaches at the University of New South Wales. She identified their compatibility during her interview and perceived “that [they] would work very well together, that [their] project would really be going somewhere, and that [she] would learn an awful lot doing a SURF with him,” (Elsa). At the conclusion of her successful SURF, she wrote a Python pipeline that systematically searches for young planets in data from TESS (NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite). Finding a mentor is simple and while there are countless mentors to choose from, obtaining a research position requires tenacity and drive. Mahider Gessesse, a current sophomore pursuing a major in Computational and Neural Systems (CNS), participated in a SURF with Clayton Mosher from the Rutishauser Lab at Cedars Sinai Hospital. She worked on quantifying the effects of brain pulsation due to the cardiac cycle on the detection and sorting of neural spike trains. She claims that “persistence is everything”. Even though “being a Caltech student no doubt [makes] this process easier [by facilitating students to] go up and talk to professors” and potential mentors, one is not guaranteed an immediate position. Sometimes professors and/or PIs of labs are “too busy to respond to emails, but [it is important to] try and try again. ” Oftentimes, to increase your chances of securing a spot as a research mentee, you need to take initiative and convey your excitement for the lab’s research. For example, you can go “to the lab, in person, on multiple occasions” to learn more about the project, introduce yourself, and highlight your qualifications and desire to contribute to the project (Mahider). The process of applying for a SURF is made easier with help from the many resources available at Caltech that aid in all aspects of the SURF application process. Ismail Elmengad is a sophomore interested in Physics. He participated in a theoretical physics SURF where he studied mathematical structures involved in certain supersymmetry models alongside Professor Jim Gates at Brown University. In his experience, “the SURF application would have been pretty difficult on [his] own, but the CaltechStudent-Faculty Programs (SFP) Office provided great help in the process. They created a schedule with unofficial deadlines to guide and track [his] progress [and] helped [him] search for reasonable professors…to contact, given [his] interests,” (Ismail). In addition to the SFP office, Caltech’s Hixon Writing Center provides workshops detailing what constitutes a successful project proposal as well as sessions where students can receive feedback on their technical writing. In addition to these helpful resources, almost everyone at Caltech is passionate about helping students secure a SURF. A perfect example of this is Diana Frias Franco, a sophomore pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering. A month before the deadline to submit her project proposal, Diana had yet to find a mentor and/or research project. When speaking to “Monique Thomas from the Caltech Center for Inclusion and Diversity (CCID)…about [her] major and what [she] wanted to learn this summer” she was referred and introduced to her summer mentor, Dr. Melany Hunt, “a wonderful leader and advocate for students on campus” (Diana). It was through networking with those at the CCID and Diana’s persistence that she landed a SURF, alongside Dr. Hunt, analyzing a NASA experiment that flew on the ISS (Packed Bed Reactor Experiment) and looking at trends and characterizations of nitrogen gas/liquid water flow in a packed bed system with no influence of gravity. Due to circumstances surrounding COVID-19, SURF programs this year were more challenging because most of them took place remotely. Nevertheless, Techers are resilient and many of my fellow students had wonderful SURF experiences! Anna Li, a sophomore studying Chemistry, for example, conducted research in the Goddard and Fischer lab at Caltech and worked on computational chemistry. She used molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics calculations to better understand the photo-assembly and mechanisms of the oxygen-evolving complex in Photosystem II. She is “glad for the skills and knowledge [she] gained, as well as…the experience of what research is like, specifically, what it is like to ask questions about why something happens and figure out ways to try to answer that question. It helped…realize that [she would] like to go to graduate school in order to continue doing research,” (Anna). Additionally, Tea Freedman-Susskind, who is also pursuing a major in chemistry, investigated the impact of mutations on anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody binding stability and used this analysis to help build a machine-learning-driven pipeline to design better antibodies to treat COVID-19 over the summer. She worked at the City of Hope National Medical Center in the Jonsson Computational Lab. In her opinion, it “was very exciting to get to extend and apply the thermodynamic concepts [she] learned in class to such an important topic” and felt grateful “to be able to contribute to such an urgently needed body of knowledge,” (Tea). Much like many SURFs this year, due to the pandemic, I also had to conduct my SURF remotely. As I mentioned in my first post, “From Algorithms to Sprung Rhythms”, I am a current intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This is a continuation of my SURF project from last summer. Growing up, my dream has always been to one day work for NASA. However, I didn’t know exactly how to bridge the gap between my dream and making it reality. I didn’t know anyone who worked at NASA and much less a female or member or a minority in STEM. This never stopped me though. I knew that if I stayed focused and determined, I would eventually figure it out. When I got to Caltech and learned that JPL was offering SURF positions for the summer of 2020, I made it my mission to apply for and land one of them. This was not an easy task. For starters, JPL doesn’t usually take college freshmen or sophomores. I sent out about 30 emails with my resume attached, eager to find a research mentor. When I didn’t get any responses back, I began cold calling. The first few times, I was extremely nervous. Getting rejected over the phone isn’t the most pleasant experience and it hurts a lot more than not getting a response. Honestly, about two weeks before the deadline to submit my project proposal, I thought that I wasn’t going to get a SURF at JPL. However, as the Japanese proverb says, “Fall seven times, stand up eight. ” For every rejection I got, I was that much closer to an acceptance - I just needed to be persistent. It wasn’t until I emailed and called one final person, whom I almost didn’t contact because I had felt so defeated, that I was offered an opportunity to conduct Aerospace Engineering research at JPL. This was a big accomplishment for me, and I truly feel fortunate to have landed this opportunity! With 76 Nobel Laureates on its roster, it’s no surprise that Caltech is a breeding ground for exceptional research opportunities! “Being a Caltech student [definitely makes] the SURF process easier since…there is such a culture of learning on campus…excited to help [you grow]!” (Diana). And though the process may seem daunting, there is no need to be “timid when contacting potential mentors. Oftentimes, potential mentors are happy to take on a young student for the summer,” (Ismail). However, like with everything else, there are no guarantees. It’s important to “start early, be clear about what you’re interested in,” and remain focused and determined (Tea).  "

I am the oldest child in a family of four and live with my parents and younger brother in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am first-generation Mexican-American and the first female in my family to study STEM. Currently, I am a sophomore at Caltech pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace Engineering. On campus, I am a member of Ruddock House, Club Latino, Women Mentoring Women, an Admissions Ambassador, and a volunteer tutor helping local at-risk high school students through the Caltech Y Rise Tutoring program. Off campus, I am an intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), using machine-learning to research ionospheric and atmospheric remote sensing. Geomagnetic storms, charged particle precipitation, plasma convection, and associate dynamics in the high-latitude ionosphere can produce various ionospheric disturbances depending on location, geomagnetic conditions, and presence of field-aligned currents. These disturbances, including plasma instabilities, give rise to irregular structures in ionospheric density distribution, or ionospheric irregularities. My task is to apply machine-learning techniques to develop a prediction system, using historical GPS and magnetometer data, to predict the location, time, and intensity of these irregularities. The goal is to use these predictions to eventually reduce signal reception interruptions and improve the integrity of navigation and communication technology applications that rely on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and GPS data. My post-Caltech plan is to attend graduate school and obtain a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering. Subsequently, I would like to work for NASA and be involved in groundbreaking research that will help to improve the quality of life across the globe. I’m thrilled to join the Caltech Fission team as a new blogger and look forward to sharing with you my experience, both as a Techer as well as an intern at JPL! "

    "body": "2020/10/17 - Annyeonghaseyo! Rather than continuing to stay at home, this term I’m taking my online classes from Seoul, Korea. This sounds a bit crazy, but it ended up working for me for a couple of reasons: first I have a friend who has been living in Seoul for the past year who I could live with. Second, all my classes this term are recorded lectures. Third, I found a special student VISA that lets me stay in Korea for 18 months with the benefit of being able to quarantine in my own apartment. And finally, Korea has incredibly low COVID-19 rates compared to the US. I’ve been here about a month now and am starting to pick up some Korean and starting to understand all the cultural norms. I still don’t bow enough when meeting people! But taking a step back, let me quickly cover how I got here. Journey to Korea: Traveling to Korea was a bit of a mess, so here’s a quick rundown of how I did it:  I packed everything I needed and stored the rest in the 36 hours between my internship finishing on a Friday and my flight early Sunday morning from LAX My second flight from Vancouver to Seoul got delayed by 20 hours due to a Typhoon, but fortunately I was given a hotel room nearby to stay the night I was stopped at the gate and told I might need a COVID-19 test due to new regulations that came out a few days prior. After waiting around for 15 minutes with peak anxiety, the gate attendant said I was good to go After the 12-hour flight, it took another 8 hours to fill out the quarantine paperwork, wait for a special quarantine bus, and eventually make it to the apartment I would be staying inWith that all behind me, I hunkered down for my 2-week total lockdown quarantine. I spent most of my time studying and taking the GRE, but after I was able to work on my orbital dynamics research. Overall, I didn’t find quarantine to be too terrible and was happy to get that work out of the way before classes! Breaking Free and Exploring!: My first night free, and many nights since, my two friends I’m living with and I went out to an all you can eat pork belly restaurant that has some fantastic food! We got to wear these cool aprons to and keep all the drippings off ourselves.  I have also started training with a swim team here called Swim Monster. I have to say, their team is aptly named because every practice has been very tough. But while I’m working on getting back into shape I’m getting good with my Korean numbers! Between distances, intervals, and the coaches reading off times, I get more than enough practice hearing numbers. Enough about me for now, let me know what you all would like to read about next: Caltech or Korea? Note: the thumbnail is not actually Seoul, it was a photo I took when I visited Incheon "

    "body": "2020/10/16 - These past six months have been a whirlwind- from having to move out of Caltech housing in March within a week’s notice due to COVID-19, to starting the first term of my junior year, I’ve definitely experienced a lot of change. When I went home in March, it was to a completely new state-my family moved from Chino, CA to New Jersey in January (great timing, huh?). While I missed seeing my friends from home, it was fun to have the chance to explore a completely new place. The pandemic obviously limited what I could see and do, but I got to experience walks through nature and along rivers normally foreign to a SoCal native and had some time to focus on bioinformatics research for the lab I work with on campus. A mini vacation: In September, my parents and I took a road trip to see a bit more of the East Coast, stopping in Boston and Newport, RI. Boston’s cobblestone streets and brick brownstones hold a very quaint charm, and I think it’s a place I could eventually see myself living one day. Newport was pretty much the New England sailing town of my dreams. I love (like, LOVE) being on boats, and it’s been a long-time goal of mine to learn to sail! In Newport I got to board a real sail-powered boat for the first time, in the same waters where one of the world’s most famous sailing regattas (the America’s Cup) takes place.  After six months of being cooped up inside, our small trip was a welcome way for me to say goodbye to the East Coast before I would be moving back to California for term. Coast to coast: I’m now living with a couple of fellow Techers at my fourth residence of the year in Redondo Beach, CA. Since settling into our place we’ve spent most of our time in the kitchen trying out new recipes for meals and desserts.  Our house menu might include: garlic naan made from scratch (it’s even better than at some restaurants I’ve been to), kimchi tofu dumplings, homemade Olive Garden copy-cat breadsticks, sourdough pizza, or lace cookies! Our sourdough starter (Michael Bublé) and our basil plant (taking name suggestions) are always ready to lend a hand. Check out my roommate’s baking insta (@yeastofourworries) if you want to see our bakes! My roommates and I at the beach, which is only a 10-minute drive from home! While I never would have imagined that this is what my 2020 would look like, I’m glad that it’s involved some adventure.

It’s month 6 of quarantine and I’m writing to you from Colorful Colorado (also known as the state where it snowed last week and was 95 out today). Climate change? Maybe. International conspiracy by the Greek God Zeus to make me miss Pasadena and Caltech more than I already do? Most definitely. Anyways, I’ve been up to a lot this summer. I’ll be posting more updates and reflection posts as time moves on, but we’re finally fully operational on the new Caltech blog! In fact, I’m currently writing this post in Dillinger. io, an online tool that lets me preview markdown files as I write them. But beyond that, I’ve been hanging out with long lost friends from high school, and, most importantly, takingn time to relax and recover before our next term starts next week. The PhotosAs one of my main photography projects this summer I’ve been hanging out with my favorite twins, Ryan and Reagan. For our great photography project we’ve been going to all the places we have bad memories of and shooting funny pictures. First up in this was actually the place we met, Mountain Vista High School. Now, you’re probably thinking to yourself, but Andrew, you went to Littleton High School. You would very much be correct, but that doesn’t mean that I, much like many Colorado natives, do not have bad memories associated with Vista. High school in and of itself feels more and more like a fever dream these days. First up, of course, an ode to Moby Dick, the book I re-read for Caltech’s Herman Melville class. A truly great story of an attachment that could never be, and the man who lost his life because of. Next, a real-time picture of how I looked after taking the state-mandated standardized testing every single year. We didn’t stop at Vista though, we also took the time to go to Civic Green Park. Another pinnacle of Highlands Ranch locations that everyone seems to remember poorly for one reason or another. My story will be left as an exercise to the reader. At the end of the day though, what I think these photos have proved to me is that no matter how bad some memories are, they can always be re-written. Places are but objects that we project are emotions unto. And on that thought, I’ll sign off until next time. “Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to.

For those of you who didn’t follow the old blog, it’s nice to meet you. My name is Andrew and I’m a senior at Caltech studying geophysics and English literature. Throughout this summer, our local webmaster Brian (EE ’21) has been working on a new website for our old Caltech admissions blog “Theory of Connection” and we’re thrilled to finally be able to share it with you. We’ll be posting a bit more on the specific development process of the blog in the upcoming weeks, but for now we wanted to take a second to reflect on the unprecedented times we’re living through and introduce you to Caltech Fission. For better or for worse, we’re living through arguably the most historic time in recent US history. As writer’s it is ever important to catalog and reflect on the unique experiences of the modern world under COVID-19. Caltech students as a general have done a lot during the quarantine period. We’ve worked remote internships. We’ve developed social distancing solutions. We’ve slept too much and exercised too little. We’ve baked cakes, hiked mountains, and failed to recreate TikTok. We’ve enjoyed online classes and we’ve missed our friends. Times are different, but we’re still the same people at the heart of it all. We’re all living through unprecedented times, each in our own Caltech-y ways. And so be warned: our new blog is more than just a stylistic change. We have new content. New bloggers. New styles. COVID-19 has dramatically impacted all of our lives in different ways, and for this next term, whether we’re at home with our parents, Puerto Vallarta (some of my friends are actually renting a house out there for fall term), or out in LA, we’re looking forward to sharing our stories with you. Hopefully, in the process, you’ll gain a better understanding of Caltech and what it means to be a Caltech student. So, stay tuned for some old updates, some new faces, and some good vibes! I’ll end with a quote from Raymond Carver: “I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone’s heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark. ” The rest will be left as an exercise for the reader.

Last night was the department of geological and planetary sciences (GPS) paint night, or, as it’s colloquially known, “deepening the GPS ++++++++++ love” (Dustin adds a + to the end each time that it happens). GPS as a department is fairly tight-knit; it’s hard not to be when you’re all taking classes together and going on field trips to who-knows-where. As such, we have lots of bonding-type activities throughout the week: we have social hours on Fridays, events throughout the week with research presentations and discussions. We even run our own softball team during the summer season (cleverly called “strike-slip”, just like the infamous San Andreas fault). But every now and then we have nighttime activities for bonding purposes, and painting night is truly the classic one of those. Especially for me, paint night has been a great way to deepen friendships with grad students in our department. GPS is very graduate student heavy. As of right now I know maybe 7 other undergrads in the department, and most of my classes (at least, at this point, are majority graduate students). So, with paint night basically we get a bunch of canvases, a bunch of cheap paint, and we all get together and just paint for a couple hours. It’s a very wholesome evening and a very nice time altogether.  There’s a big range of artistic abilities in the department, and not everyone is painting either. Emma, one of the grad students, is an extremely talented artist and spends her time during paint night just working on whichever beautiful drawing she’s working on that given week. Then, there are people like me and Toby, who, although not completely artistically untalented, are certainly not the creators of beautiful art every week. This week, I decided to try something new: making the geometric art that I’ve always hated seeing in galleries in Los Angeles. Specifically, I painted one small white canvas. I like to think deep down that the white represents my deep lack of confidence in the world and in the love in the world that we live in. I mean, I did TRY to outline a heart in white paint. However, it really didn’t show up, so it’s just white paint like any other white paint. Or is it? Art is what you make of it, –Chandrew "

    "body": "2020/02/08 - Happy Friday y’all! In all my abundant free time (which obviously exists) I’ve started volunteering with the Pasadena Unified School District. I’ve been working assisting their after-school program LEARNS, specifically helping with the Chemistry Olympiad and also running experiments for the kids to keep them engaged in science. One of the thigs I love about Caltech is all the opportunities for volunteer and community work. The Caltech Y ensures there are great opportunities for all types of service work from what I do with LEARNS to work in LA homeless shelters, and more. It’s a great organization and honestly doesn’t get enough love most of the time. This week the experiment we ran was the “whoosh bottle”. I know that sounds mysterious, but what you need is ethanol, and one of the 5-gallon water bottles that they sell at Home Depot or your local grocery store. (ALSO DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!!!!!!!). Luckily, both of those ingredients are fairly easy to obtain, although we really confused the lady at the Home Depot by specifically requesting empty water bottles. So, once you have the ethanol and the empty (and dry – this is very important to maximize the “whoosh”) you pour a small amount of ethanol in the bottle, swish it around, and then light it on fire. To properly practice safety with this experiment, we attached a long reach match to a dowel rod. It looked bad but keeps your hands out of the range of the flame. Usually you use a normal match and just drop it in, however we couldn’t find normal sized matches at home depot and figured this would be a suitable substitute. I learned how to do this experiment as a part of chem club, a club that does chemistry outreach similar to what we do with LEARNS, however a lot more infrequently and for shorter periods of time. We have a few other great experiments planned for LEARNS, including the ever-classic gummy bear in potassium perchlorate (maybe even the GIANT gummy bear in potassium perchlorate), an osmosis egg, and all sorts of other wonderful science things. In-terms of projects for chem Olympiad, we’ve made slime and built some bridges out of notecards. All of their activities are pretty fun and low stress and so they do a great job of keeping the kids involved. Don’t “bottle” your emotions” –Chandrew "

    "body": "2020/01/18 - After a week being back, I think it’s about time for some reflections on what it meant to be abroad, and what I’ve taken away from it. I’m really happy to be back, but it’s just been almost a culture shock of sorts being back in California, and back at my true home (for now, at least). Of course, my parents wouldn’t say that Caltech is my home, but I think that may be one of the first things I realized when I was abroad; when people ask me where I’m from I’d always say that I was born in Denver and I live in Los Angeles. In a lot of ways, bit by bit, I’ve become more and more of a Los Angeles convert. Still a Colorado native at heart, but a Los Angeles native. I really do love Los Angeles. When I stepped off the plane in Burbank flying in I remembered a bit of that. The rolling hills, warm air, and palm trees. It is its own kind of magic. I’ll be honest, I miss Singapore. I miss waking up knowing that one of the best roast duck plates I’ve ever had is a 2-minute walk and $3 away. I miss fencing in the suffocating humidity, and even taking the bus to work every single morning. Singapore in a lot of ways felt like a place I truly belonged, an Asian country with a huge British influence, just like how I’m an Asian person with a large amount of American influence. I miss Scotland too, but a little bit less so. I don’t think I connected to Scotland quite as much as I did to Singapore. It was scold, for one, and as I’m sure y’all readers have figured out, I can’t really deal with cold weather. I really do miss all my friends though. I miss the late evenings out with Justin, the lack of homework, the constant, nonstop travelling. It was a great time being abroad, and it feels almost wrong to be stagnant in one location for the rest of the year.  And my takeaway from all of this is that I can find those same things back here at Tech too. I can take a weekend and go down to San Diego or camping in the mountains. I can hunt for that cheap and delicious roast duck. So that’s my takeaway. Life doesn’t need to change, but instead expand from all of the experiences that you live through. Take those same life lessons and apply them to your daily life. Think deep and learn, –Chandrew "

    "body": "2020/01/15 - The CaltechY hosts a Friends Dinner once every quarter to thank its supporters and provide them with an opportunity to network with the Y’s student leaders. Each event features one special speaker. In the past, there have been artists, professors, film makers and more. This time, it was one of Caltech’s chemistry professors, Peter Jonas, who spoke about the vision surrounding the new Resnick gift. The dinners are all held at the Athenaeum. Since this event was pretty close to Christmas, the Ath was completely decked out in holiday decor, making it venue seem extra grand. Of course, since its the Ath, there is great food. The menu that night featured a fancy salad, roast chicken and veggies and the most delicious chocolate lava cake I’ve ever had. I gave an intro for the evening, welcoming people to the event and welcoming the featured student speaker of the night, and while doing so, people were already distracted by the food. Luckily, the main speaker of the night was programmed after the dessert. I mentioned previously that the talk was centered around the Resnick gift, but it also touched upon a lot of the current sustainability research at Caltech. One of the major incentives is artificial photosynthesis. I won’t go into details about the content of the talk, because my understanding of the contents is actually quite shallow. However, the idea is that we are quite close to being able to synthesize sugars from more abundant sources in our atmosphere. This makes me a lot more hopeful and excited about the sustainability of carbon-intensive industries. I am not sure who is speaking at the next Friends Dinner in the spring. When it does happen, I will provide you with a more detailed synopsis. The photo below is taken by photographer Bob Paz. "

That’s one of my new classes for this term. Also included: plate tectonics, seismology, field geophysics, physics lab, and a design-your-own English class about American minimalism as a prep-course for my thesis (which I’m hoping to start next term). So far, it’s shaping up to be a great term. It doesn’t look like I’ll have any midterms (the perk of being in all graduate-level geosciences courses) and my homework load seems mostly… doable? I’m glad that it is after a couple months of not really having formal homework in Scotland. Anyways though, this post is more about my weekend than it is about my week. I spent the entire weekend cooking with the Caltech Senior Director of Activities and Programs Tom Mannion. First up, we made… more fruitcake?? Yes, I did just make fruitcake like last weekend. But hey, I never say no to more delicious combinations of fruit, sugar, and coffee. Plus, Tom did the intelligent thing and ordered our fruit for the cake off the internet, so I didn’t have to candy any peels this time around.  Next up, sorbet! The University president has orange trees and had sent over a delivery of a bunch of oranges from them. Us, being the savvy chefs, we are, did the reasonable thing and made many iterations of orange and lemon sorbets. We mixed fruits, sugar, and a menagerie of everything else to end up with a few delicious icy combinations, although it wasn’t all too fitting since the weather was actually a wee bit chilly for Pasadena (a shocking 50 degrees!). To celebrate a day of hard work, we went to the home of the original French dip for some delicious sandwiches.  Sunday, we baked out fruitcakes, and prepared live lobster and crab for a proper New-England style shellfish dinner. It was my first time ever having whole lobster, and man, was that a delicious dinner. Also, it was much easier to dissect for its meat than the crab was. I can see why people are a fan of this lifestyle. We also served it with some scalloped potatoes that Tom made, and a bit of a vegetable medley stir fry that Susan cooked up. "

And, after 11 countries (not including layovers) my trip around the world in about 180 days has been completed. I’m home. I have to say though, it didn’t really feel like home until I had my first boba back. While I was gone my true home away from home, Labobatory, opened their second location in Pasadena. First thing I did when I got in: started moving into my new apartment. Oh yeah! That’s a good note here – I’m living off-campus this term. I figured I’d be used to cooking for myself by the time I got back from abroad. So, I didn’t really fancy the idea of going back to a world of pre-prepared Caltech dining services meals. More on that to come. But anyways I’m living a block North of campus with Marcel; together we form the flat of… well… all the geophysics majors at the California Institute of Technology. It’s super spacious, and generally pretty nice, but it’s definitely a bit weird living far away from campus (and by far I mean a 10 minute walk). Although, having been about that distance from uni at Edinburgh, I guess it really shouldn’t. Anyways, I had to move in there right when I got in Sunday. And then, I went to LABOBATORY! The new Pasadena location is quite excellent. They’re making all of their pearls in-house, so basically, it’s now objectively and subjectively the best bubble tea in Los Angeles. I missed good bubble tea. Like yikes Chatime looks bad compared to this.  It’s nice to see all of my friends too, it’s a bit wild that it had been a whole 6 months. Unpacking was a bit more hectic than I thought it would be. Turns out I have a lot more stuff than I thought I’d left. And I forgot about my typewriters! Get ready for some artsy writing posts. Last thing: I did some grocery shopping. It was really great being back in LA Asian markets. Kinda felt like a nice breath of Singapore and everything came back to the start of the summer. So, I waltzed off with my 3lb can of milo into the California sunset, breathed out a sigh, and thought about how nice it was to be home. –Chandrew "

Instead, I’ve been taking advantage of my home’s superior kitchen to concoct all the baked goods I wanted to make (but couldn’t) while I was abroad. And it all started (as it usually does) with fruitcake. This was actually the same fruitcake I made last year on Caltech campus, only with a few special twists this year for our family’s annual holiday brunch. Every year my godparents (yes, the same ones that were in Ireland with me!!!) and my family go out for brunch. This year, however, my grandmother is staying with my family, so we decided to have brunch at our house instead. My brother was preparing the main, and I the dessert. The adventure of the day was candying my own fruit for the fruitcake. Funny enough, there isn’t a store that sells candied orange/lemon peel at this time of year. And I candied my own Yuzu lemon to go along with it! (it was a substitute for citron). Beyond that, the fruitcake was pretty straightforward. I messed around a bit and made a caramel sauce as well as some caramel art to class it up a bit, and there ya go! Instant dessert! ![https://ug-admissions-caltech-blog-dev. s3-us-west-1. amazonaws. com/old_pictures/6a0105349b8251970b0240a4b10a2e200c-800wi. jpg] Next up was a red velvet cake.

    "body": "2020/01/04 - There’s nothing more festive than beautiful holiday decor. Something that has gotten quite popular in recent years is light displays. Around Pasadena, the LA Zoo, LA Arboretum are a few venues that have elaborate holiday light displays. This past weekend, I went to check out the LA Zoo Lights. The general admission is ~$15 on weekdays and ~$20 on weekends, which is certainly not cheap, so if you do go, be sure to take a ton of photos. I went with two of my friends, one of whom has a pro photography gear. He brought two sets of lenses and a tripod. We never got to use the tripod since it was rather crowded. However, his two sets of lenses were quite useful. One was suited for panoramic shots, the other for close ups and special effects. Right when you walk in, you are blinded by all the LEDs. There is a center piece that looks like a float at a parade. Surrounding the display are little pop-ups where local artisans sell their goods, including fancy salsa, jewelry and prints. We got some churros and hot chocolate since it was fairly chilly out. Most of the animal exhibits were closed, with the exception of the snakes exhibit. We saw a variety of baby snakes, but did not see any pythons or cobras. Outside, was this massive web and spider made of lights. There were also light sculptures of flamingos, frogs and elephants along the path. One thing I really like about the displays is how well-planned they are. There are arrows guiding you from one exhibit to the next so you walk and optimized path without repeating sights.  The highlight of the place is this light tunnel. It’s essentially just a 100 meter tunnel lined with fairy lights of all colors. The beginning is white lights, then rainbow lights, before ending in golden lights. This is where everyone takes photos and shares to social media. We managed to get some nice pictures here, but it was quite touch to wait for the moments when the background is not filled with people. We left soon after that since it was freezing out. Well, freezing by LA standards, so like in the 50s temperature-wise.  The Zoo Lights were definitely beautiful, but I don’t think I would go back again. I think they recycle the same displays year after year, so I wouldn’t pay to see the same thing again. However, if you have never been, I do think it’s a worthwhile experience. "

In Colorado, definitely, but more so just being in the US. I think the biggest shock for me was walking into the Safeway grocery store that’s about a half mile from my house. It’s… huge. I never really realized this until I was abroad but American stores in general are just massive. It was the first time I’d seen a butcher’s counter inside a store in who knows how long. Even at the giant FairPrice in Singapore I don’t remember seeing anything like that. FairPrice was more like a miniature target. And then the UK stores were all TINY compared to that. It’s just a strange and different model. Anyways, that’s probably enough about grocery stores for now. I also went to the local Asian market and man oh man have I missed being surrounded by every sort of Asian food that I could physically ask to have. I’m sure you’re probably wondering how it is adjusting in general though. First, Colorado is a lot warmer than Scotland. Not physically, actually it dropped about ten degrees colder within a couple days of me being back. But, there’s no humidity here. In-fact, it’s so dry that writing this a week after being back (and countless gallons of water) I am STILL dehydrated. This makes it feel infinitely less cold than Scotland does. There’s also no windchill and that helps too. Secondly, everyone here is… American. Everything is American. And that’s not a bad thing. There are big portion sizes of food. Soft drinks that don’t have artificial sweeteners. Also, I’m ridiculously jetlagged. I have been for a week. It’s not awful, but I’ve been getting tired at 8PM and waking up around 7AM (very different from my typical 2AM-10AM sleep schedule). Either way it’s certainly nice being back. After half a year outside of the US it’s a bit refreshing to be back in a culture that’s familiar. And where I don’t constantly have to explain why I pronounce things all funny-like. Finally, it snowed. I don’t like snow. It’s all wet and cold, and irritating. And it GETS EVERYWHERE! I don’t like sand –Chandrew "

    "body": "2020/01/02 - I visited Amsterdam for a brief two and a half days during my vacation. There were a few landmarks and neighborhoods I wanted to checkout, but did not plan the visit in detail. As such, when it came down to destinations with ticketed entries, I had to skip most of them, since they did not have day-of tickets left for sale. Fortunately, I was able to walk around most of the city and it was generally a good time. I’ll start out with the worst part of Amsterdam, the cold. According to the weather website, it was supposed to be in the low 40s. However, we found that the weather was actually around the 30s. Furthermore, due to the fog, the air is quite humid, so it felt even colder than it actually was. We arrived early afternoon on NYE and checked into Generator, our hostel. After grabbing a quick dinner at the hostel restaurant, we walked into the city to checkout De Wallen, or Red Light District as we know it. Although there is a lot of controversy surrounding that neighborhood, it is one of the most historic and iconic parts of the city. Regardless of your political stance on the issues, it’s worth checking out. There were a few “city squares” there where many roads intersected. In these squares, people lit fireworks and fire crackers on their own. Apparently, there were no official NYE fireworks, so these local festivities were sought after instead. While the fireworks were exciting and pretty, it left the streets super smoky. Along with the fog, we could barely a few meters in from of us. However, on our walk to the district, we had seen a lot of the pretty bridges and canals. Also, walking in the fog is a different vibe. It made the city seem even more mysterious and intriguing.  The day after, we took a day trip to Old Holland, which I will cover in a different post. During our remaining in Amsterdam though, we visited the Albert Cuyp Market, a famous outdoor market open daily from 9am-5pm that is comparable to Borough Market in London. Market vendors sold everything from leather jackets to green juices to stroopwaffles. The waffles were certainly what you should go for. A lot of the booths had XXL waffles for 1. 50 euros, and these waffles were the size of my head. I heard that the Original Stroopwaffle stall is where you should go, but it was still setting up when we were there. I’m sure the other places are delicious as well. If I did not have a big brunch right before, I would have eaten a giant one or two, easily.  If we had more time to spend in the city, we would have visited several museums. We were interested in the Anne Frank House, but unfortunately, the tickets were sold out. For that museum, tickets for 2 weeks from today are released. 80% of the tickets are sold online prior to the day, and the remaining 20% is sold on the day of at 9am. I tried queueing online for day of tickets, but ended up on the waitlist at position 320. Right when it got down to 14 people in the queue, we were kicked out of line as the tickets were completely sold out. Other notable museums include the Rembrandt house and the R* Museum. There’s a super cool “I Amsterdam” sign on the lawns of the R Museum that you have probably seen all over instagram. I wish I had gotten a photo myself, but it was out of my way. "

    "body": "2020/01/01 - Snowboarding with my friend Cecilia is an annual occasion when I go home for the holidays. Cecilia and I actually learned snowboarding a few years ago. We signed up for these intro lessons, but arrived at the slopes early and thought that we would try a run before the lesson to see where we at. We were slightly confused, so took the lift to a green run instead of the bunny hills. We got down that run 80% on our butt and 20% on our feet, but it was a great start. By the end of that day’s lesson, we were getting down that same run 80% on our feet. Of course, now we are much better. We chose to go during peak season. Even though we had purchased lift tickets and rentals well ahead, we had to wait about an 1hr in line to pick everything up. There were just that many people that day. I was almost concerned that they would run out of equipment. Anyways, if you visit Cyprus, I would highly recommend purchasing online ahead of time since there is at least a 10% discount and it saves you so much hassle on the day of. Also, for adults, rentals do not include a helmet, but if you value your head and its health, you should probably rent one for an additional 10 dollars. Getting back on the slopes felt quite strange. I feel like I never use my quads that much in real life, after a few runs, my legs felt like jelly. Also, since there were a lot of people, it was difficult trying to go fast and avoid everyone. It’s terrifying going down a run with inexperienced snowboarders and skiers since you don’t know if they will suddenly slide to a stop or will lose control and come flying at you. In addition, it was sunny that day, so the conditions were rather icy. Another hinderance were the clouds that eventually became fog. Not being able to see far ahead on a crowded slope was quite a challenge. I think I was able to get about 6 runs in before we had to take the bus back home. I also don’t think I could go for any longer since I had taken a few falls by that point and my entire lower body was sore. Although the conditions were not ideal, it felt good to be back. I wished I could go a couple more times, but I had other plans for the remainder of my break. Perhaps I will visit Big Bear or Mammoth in the new year, or will go more next winter.  "

I didn’t do much in London; I had a very specific agenda and didn’t have a lot of time leftover for anything else. I really only had one day there, and spent most of it getting to and exploring the Royal Botanic Gardens, or Kew Gardens as it’s often called. The gardens were everything I could’ve ever wanted. Tranquil greenhouses, a huge, expansive arboretum. And, my personal favorite: not one, but TWO rooms entirely dedicated to carnivorous plants. And the bonus, it was a bit dreary that day, so the entire grounds were deserted. A tranquil and perfect way to spend my last day in the UK. But, of course, I didn’t stop there. Justin, David, and I all went out for a spot of tea and ended the day by seeing Les Misérables, the last of my favorite musicals that I hadn’t seen live. Les Mis was excellent. Honestly one of the best theater performances I’ve ever seen. I had chills during the entire performance and the singing was so good that it made me seriously doubt the credentials of whoever cast the movie. All in all though, it was hard to say goodbye. Maybe even harder than with Singapore. I really am going to miss everything. The fencing team workouts. Nanyang with Justin. Having professors that exclusively speak in Scottish accents (not even lying, this makes classes at least 2x as exciting). But I think it’s time for me to go home. I think it has been for awhile now. I’m not horribly cold tolerant and it’s about time I return to the land of palm trees, sunshine, and bubble tea that’s actually worth the $4 you pay for it. And food. I definitely won’t miss Scottish food. Honestly can’t say I’d be heartbroken if I didn’t cross paths with IRN BRU (Scotland’s national drink) for a bit.  And so for my last meal in the United Kingdom I ate Old Chang Kee curry puffs. Everything came full circle. 6 months ago, getting off a plane in Singapore and thinking to my self “what on earth am I doing with my life?” All the way to now. 12 countries (not including layovers). 6 months. One very tired, but not quite homesick 20 year-old. And his final curry puff.  Until next time, — Chandrew "

And yes, unlike at Caltech where I have been known to take the occasional 100 mile trip to go to the beach and get Korean-American fusion during finals week, I am STRESSED. Actually though, this has been quite likely the most stressful week of my life since my last week of IB exams in high school. Granted though, I had reason for that. I had four exams this season, three of which were this week, and two of which were yesterday. A normal Edinburgh student usually takes three classes and only has one or two of those with exams. So let’s just say it was a bit of a heavy load for me this term. Even my other caltech friends didn’t have 4 tests. And it’s further stressful because the testing format is about as dissimilar from Caltech’s as one could physically get. All but one of my exams were closed book. I already learned the hard way on hydrogeology that that doesn’t mean that the exams are any less comprehensive on material, they just expect you to memorize legitimately everything (which is something I am historically bad at). Furthermore, the exams are all held in lecture halls in very strict, proctored exams. The sort of place where you have to raise your hand if you want to go to the bathroom.  Actually it really is funny how much these tests resembled my IB tests. Even the pink paper they used for the answer books was exactly the same. I was even able to recreate my high school pre-test ritual, with a new Scottish twist. Usually in high school I would drink an energy drink and listen to pump-up tunes ending with Eminem’s ‘Till I Collapse (dorky, I know). In Scotland I’ve now added the LIDL brand chocolate chip muffin as the healthy and nutritious breakfast that I need to fuel my brain through an exam. Realistically, they’re pretty mediocre muffins, but I’ve had a minor addiction to chocolate muffins and they’re the most price-per-quality-efficient option given my rate of consumption. Anyways, I have one more exam tomorrow: Land-Atmosphere Interactions. This is going to be my second hardest test, but luckily I only need a 31 on it to pass, so I’m luckily a bit less stressed. But also, I have to finish packing today (which is what I’ve procrastinated). So cheers to that haha. Also enjoy the assortment of random Edinburgh pictures. They wouldn’t let me take selfies in the exam room. To passing all my classes! And thank goodness I’ll never have to sit finals like this again. — Chandrew "

I did my final wee bit of Scotland exploration this week, which is to say, I finally did the one touristy thing I’d been avoiding doing for all too long. I went to Edinburgh Castle. AND I went INSIDE Edinburgh Castle. I’ve been avoiding this a bit for a few reasons. First, it’s rather cold and windy in Edinburgh, and the castle is at the top of a hill, where it is colder, and windier (lame excuse, but I’m cold constantly here). Second, it’s actually a bit pricey to get in (£17) and I can buy a lot of food for that much money (also a lame excuse, but eating helps ease the pain of the cold). And third, there’s a stigma that if you visit the castle before graduation you will fail your exams. Which, I know, I’m not a full time student here. Or superstitious. But that would be a very unfortunate outcome.  Anyways. To the details. The castle isn’t really a palace or anything like that. It’s more of a series of small building protected by a wall, and sitting atop of one of Edinburgh’s 3 extinct volcanos. Each of the little building has been converted into a museum of sorts, with different information about the history of the castle, famous assaults on t he defended, and a few oddities (like the history of the Scottish guard). There was also one really big cannon that could apparently fire about two miles. That’s just a wild concept to me. The entire castle had gorgeous overlooks of the city and stunning architecture. Anyways, I figure it’s a bit better explained through pictures, so enjoy! The highlight of the day was seeing the ORIGINAL stone of scone, you know, the thing that Justin and I took the train all the way to Perth to see the replica of. Funny enough, it was just sitting in a glass case, a casual block of metamorphic rock chilling with the Scottish Crown Jewels. Of course, they wouldn’t let us have a scone with this one so that trip was still very much worth it. But it was a bit of a shock to see it here, especially because I thought it was in London. Anyways, we did make it to the castle. And, even through wind that almost knocked us off our feet a few times, we crushed being tourists. Checkmate. — Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/12/22 - It was a farewell dinner today. The beginning of the end. Crazy to think in less than a week I’ll be back in Denver and this entire country hopping adventure will be completely over. Justin and I went to the Balmoral Hotel. As a birthday gift I’d received a gift certificate for their restaurant, and there really wouldn’t have been any better way to use it than taking my best lad out for dinner. The Balmoral’s restaurant is legitimately called “Number One”. And it’s frequently regarded as the best restaurant in Edinburgh (if not the best in Scotland). It has a Michelin Star, a tasting menu, and basically everything I’ve come to love about fine dining. So let’s talk menu. The amuse bouche’s were a tasty pastry cup fish mousse, roe deer raw, and the most delicious “truffle bomb” a rice shell filled with truffly goodness. Course one was an oyster from nearby. Followed by my first time eating foie gras, with a delicious licorice bread (that really just tasted like gingerbread but was black) Then was a scallop kedigree which is really just a fancy way of saying seared scallop on potatoes.  We continued with North Sea cod, served with surprisingly delightful chanterelle mushrooms and crispy chicken skin.  Continuing on, the main course was roe deer, chervil root, and pear. This was a delightfully tender and game-flavor-free cut of meat.  After this it was on to the cheese course, where we had an interesting mix of French and Scottish cheeses, served with truffled honey.  Finally, dessert of a sea buckthorn sherbet served with carrot puree and browned butter crust. Sea buckthorn apparently tastes like tangerine.  But wait! There’s more! Last up was a bramble sherbet soufflé with apple pie ice cream.  And we got some post-dinner sweets to go along with it. A nice bit of tablet and a pineapple candy.  My favorite? Strongly the last course, the soufflé. It was by far the most technically perfect baked dish I’d ever consumed. And the flavors balanced and played with each other unlike any dessert I’ve had. This meal was a stark contrast to the Michelin street food I had in Singapore, and a similar contrast to Providence in LA. This menu was united around the theme of Scotland at the holidays. Not the general theme of seafood. Or the singular dish of the hawker stalls in Singapore. And it was a perfect goodbye meal. Food is love, — Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/12/13 - There, and back again. A Caltech student’s tale. I went back to the land of my enemy, my mortal nemesis. Or at least, the nemesis of our school. Durham, the only team currently ranked above us on the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) point list. Only, this time, I went with open arms. I believe I mentioned somewhere deep buried in this land of blogs that my dad had studied abroad in Durham, 40 years ago precisely. And on this 40-year anniversary, it seems only fitting that his son would make a return to the land of his old haunts and continue the Chan family tradition in (chilly) Durham, England.  I dragged along one of my fencing teammates with me. Well, not exactly dragged. Ardy is from Durham, and he was actually rather excited to get the opportunity to take a tourist around his home and reminisce about the wonderfully cute city he grew up in. Yet again though, this weekend adventure started with some train drama. They cancelled our train. But before too long we were on a later train and made our way into an overcast day in Durham We started out by diving headfirst into the market. We picked up some wonderful gingerbread. Gingerbread is a bit different in the UK, it is soft with hard edges, instead of being entirely soft. We also picked up some sour sweets which Ardy loved and I could barely keep in my mouth for 15 seconds. We then proceeded to the cathedral and the castle – both very prominent sites of Harry Potter filming, and old haunts of my dad’s. We had a nice solid walkthrough and spent some time enjoying the scenery before heading to a lunch at Zapatista Burrito Bar. I’ve really been craving Mexican food for the last few weeks in Scotland, so it just had to happen. It was a whirlwind of a day, with no time for stopping. After this, we went on a mile or so journey out to the oriental museum. This fascinating little gem held a shockingly large collection of Asian Artifacts, some of which were similar to what I’d seen in China freshman year. Then we hiked the nearby hill and got a gorgeous view of the Durham castle and cathedral. It did really pay off to have an insider with me. And like any good day, we ended it with a Tesco meal deal and a train ride back. It had been a long day, and we had earned our rest. There’s a storm a’comin And it’s us. –Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/12/12 - Well, the week before finals week is finally here. And I spent that studying, but also, doing the ever-important finishing of reports, and honestly, taking a couple of much-needed naps to catch up on everything else. Studying is a bit different here in Edinburgh. The biggest difference is that every single lecture is usually recorded. This means it’s very easy to have a lazy day of staying in bed and re-watching the lectures you missed or that you zoned out during. The most helpful part of this is that you can repeat parts of the lecture you don’t understand. So instead of getting pointlessly lost, you can repeat the same 5-second clip until the cows come home. The other major difference is that every past exam from any year this course has been taught is posted online. They change the exams significantly every year, so they’re able to put up all the past papers for you to do. This is quite helpful, as the exams have certain trends that allow you to pick out what the instructors think are important topics, and thus hone the area you’re studying around those subjects. And, as with any good week of studying, David and I decided to take a bit of a study break and spend some time at the holiday Christmas party. The student union (basically the student government) runs this giant venue that got out a snow machine and some sick early 2000s tunes. And free santa hats. We have a lovely photo of us sipping water and looking up and to the left. I don’t know why they felt the need to post that but who knows ahahaha.  Oh! And we got free tickets to see the dress rehearsal of The Lion King in Edinburgh. This amazing experience was courtesy of the Singapore society, and we got to go out see it just a few days before anyone else. It was a wonderfully put on show, beautiful puppets (which weirded me out for most of the time) and generally great singing – although the kids did pronounce the “can’t” in “just can’t wait to be king” with an extremely heavy London accent which was a bit odd. More theater soon! (we just got tickets to Les Mis in London – the dream of my theater life to see. ) –Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/12/06 - It is COLD here. I know I’ve said that before but hOh my goodness I almost froze to death on Saturday. Of course, this wasn’t helped by how I almost froze to death Friday night as well. But that was by personal choice. So, Friday, night before a fencing tournament (as it always is) I decided to do something rather bone-headed and so I found myself at the ice-skating rink for disco night. Ice-skating has long been a tradition of mine, and one that I skipped during last school year. I’m not a pro or anything, but I don’t fall over anymore, and I can somewhat skate backwards, and that’s usually good enough for any ice rink in California. Unfortunately, though, the same doesn’t exactly hold for Edinburgh. IT seems that at least at disco night, about half the people there are hockey players. Including the little 7-year-old kids. Trust me, I almost got run over by a couple of them playing ice tag. The disco vibe was also a bit disappointing – more Edinburgh nightclub than early 2000s pop-radio (which was what we were all expecting). Either way though, the rink was amazing, the friends were amazing, and the ice skates were shockingly mediocre (in a good way) for rentals. I left without bruises or blisters, and ready to go for another round. Only… the next round was about 4 hours away from when I got back, and it came in the form of a train to Largs. Now, where’s Largs you ask? Good question! A lot of British people wouldn’t know the answer either. Largs is a tiny town 2 hours west of Glasgow. I’ll grant you that it’s quite scenic. We saw a beautiful sunrise. But also, to see that, our train was beyond early (and actually, I missed the earliest train). Largs is also the site of the Scottish national training facility. A bit like the Olympic training center in Colorado, only Scottish and much smaller. The day of fencing was actually quite atrocious for me, but we found a lovely little ice cream shop. And we ended the evening with curry cheese chips, as any good fencing evening should.  Largs was also my last really obscure UK city trip that I’m taking for fencing this year. So, it’s a bit bittersweet. As my college fencing career will come to an end when I’m back at Caltech, this really was my last ride and it’s a bit sad. But I couldn’t have asked for anyone else to spend this season with. Largs, Largs, Pants on Fargs? –Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/12/05 - I killed today. Yes, I killed Thanksgiving dinner, but more than that, this was the first time that I’d ever prepared live seafood. But wait. You’re probably asking, “Andrew, why would you be preparing seafood for thanksgiving?” Easy to say, I don’t have the equipment or free will necessary to prepare a turkey instead. Of course, little did I know the adventure I was getting myself into by choosing to prepare Singaporean chilli crab instead. Crab was remarkably cheap here; I paid 10 quid (ten pounds) for two crabs. Only catch, they were still alive. So, after a brief trip to the freezer the crabs were humanely dispatched. Then I got to clean the crab (also an adventure). Following this, I sautéed the vegetables, then added the crab and made a thick sauce with a bit of added cornstarch. Let it boil for 20 minutes and boom! Chilli crab all done and all through. Next up, another Singaporean specialty, Hainanese chicken rice. This was a bit simpler; we just made a marinade for the chicken, boiled the chicken, and then cooked the rice in chicken fat instead of the typical water.  But wait! There’s more! It wouldn’t have been thanksgiving without at least one of my southern family’s famous thanksgiving dishes. I had a hard time deciding which of the southern favorites that I would be bringing – would it be the infamous chocolate pies? Mashed potatoes/ In the end, I settled for something in-between: mashed SWEET POTATOES! It’s a sweet potato casserole, which is a fancy code word for sweet potatoes, cream, sugar, and a topping of marshmallows. We actually didn’t even end up eating the pie we bought because of how full we were from everything else.  The crab, however, was not an easy one to eat. It was legitimately spicy (rather unlike most of the chilli crab you’d find in Singapore), but the kicker was how hard the shells were. In Singapore they specifically get a mud crab from Sri Lanka, a very fancy, high quality crab. British brown crab is definitely good, however it’s nowhere near that good. And the shell was very hard to crack. One claw took the combined effort of me, Justin, Alvin, and Chav in order to open it’s hard exterior. It did so in a rather violent explosion too. But I suppose that’s half the fun of cooking. Till next year! –Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/12/04 - Ice skating seems rather uncommon here in Southern California as there are only two year-round rinks within driving distance of Caltech. One is the Pasadena Ice Skating Center which is only minutes away, the other is the Santa Monica Rink which is way out west. The interesting thing is, the Olympic figure skating Mirai Nagasu is actually local. Her family owns a sushi restaurant in Arcadia that is only 10 minutes away. There are a lot of Caltech events at the Pasadena rink. The houses often play broomball with each other. For broomball, we would rent out the entire rink. It’s extremely fun and you do not need to know to skate to play. My friends and I have also gone a couple of times to actually skate during their public skate sessions. In fact, two weekends ago, a friend and I headed over to polish up our extremely rusty skating skills. We went right when the public skate session opened and there was already a line. It was around $15 per person with skate rentals if you had a California driver’s license. Personally, I am not a fan of skate rentals because for figure skates, they shave down the toe pick to prevent people from falling. However, for more experienced skaters, the dull toe picks simply feel strange. Even more strange is the sensation of getting back on the ice. To remind yourself to push off your back foot, glide and be confident in your balance is not that easy. As such, there are plenty of adults stumbling around the perimeter of the rink. There are also lots of amazing young figure skaters practicing in the center of the rink. We saw several doing lutz jumps and shoot the duck spins. I used to figure skate and I felt the urge to try a few of my old tricks, but I stopped myself from doing so because it could also possibly fracture my tailbone When I go home over the winter break, I will definitely go skating, and I will hopefully bring my brother along as well. Ideally, I’ll bring my own skates to campus in the new year, so I can go more frequently with my friends here. "

    "body": "2019/12/03 - I spent this Thanksgiving with one of my good friends in San Francisco. My friend is an Techer alum and she currently works in asset management. Since she did not have enough of a vacation to fly down to LA to spend the long weekend with her family, and since I was free, I went up to spend with her. Needless to say, it was a very untraditional Thanksgiving. We did not have any turkey or stuffing. Instead, we went out for sushi and brunch. One thing we did do is celebrate Black Friday. I arrived in SF around Thursday evening, and headed out for dinner right away. We went to a sushi and karaoke bar located in inner Richmond. My friend said that the restaurant is usually quite packed. However, since most people are spending Thanksgiving at home with their families, we were one of the two tables that night. We ordered, sashimi, rolls, appetizers and plenty of matcha cream puffs. Even though the food was not that heavy, we still over ate and went home in a food coma. The next morning, we got up early for yoga at the Equinox in Marina. My friend is a member and raves about the quality of facilities. I must admit that it does not disappoint. Their showers have Kiehls branded everything, and there is an unlimited supply of clean towels. After yoga, we headed to this cute brunch spot called U Dessert Story and Vintage brunch near Fillmore. We ordered the omelette rice and a matcha lava cake to split. It was absolutely delicious.  We spent the rest of the afternoon exploring Chrissy field, a grassy area with a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge, and Ocean Beach. At one point, it started raining, but the showers quickly subsided so we did not have to drastically change our plans. The highlight of that evening was catching the sunset at Ocean Beach. The beach has such a large field of view that it felt like the end of the Earth.  On Saturday, it just poured. We got brunch at Jane on Fillmore and had dinner at the Italian Homemade Company. We spent the rest of the day shopping and watching movies indoors. Although it was not that eventful, it was nice to take a break. Finally, Thanksgiving break is a trap. When I got back to campus on Sunday, I realized how behind I was on work. Luckily, I’ve been able to get back on track, so the vacation/procrastination was worthwhile. "

And even funnier, it was my mother who told me I had to go to check the place out. So, I suppose in some sense it was destiny that I woke up bright and early on a Saturday to take the two-hour bus out to St. Andrew’s. It was actually a very peaceful bus ride up, a bit of beautiful scenery, a bit of gorgeous rolling fog, and boom! We were in St. Andrew’s! The first thing Justin and I did (as we usually do) was to get breakfast! Both of us have a horrible habit of not eating before these trips, so when we arrive around noon, it’s always a perfect lunch time. We opted for a typical American brunch: fried chicken and waffles. This has actually been one of the foods I’ve been missing from the US for the last couple of months. That, cheesesteaks, Waffle House, and grocery stores that actually carry what I need to buy for dinner. Especially that last one.  After breakfast, it was time for a walking tour of St. Andrew’s. Only, it was rather rainy, so it was a bit of a brief walking tour. We started at the golf museum and the beach. The latter seems like it would’ve been beyond gorgeous in nicer weather, but alas it just wasn’t meant to be. We then went to explore the university. The architecture was a lot more reminiscent of a US old college than a historic UK University, but it was still very scenic. We then went to the castle and the cathedral (ruins). This was actually super cool; it was very reminiscent of the castle ruins I visited on the way to the Isle of Skye, but just a bit more in-tact. So very historic.  We then took refuge for the rain. At this point it was just a wee bit cold to be out exploring, so we found a coffee shop, which, funny enough, was the location of that William and Kate had their first date, many years ago. And so, we had a nice afternoon tea, and one of the best scones I’ve had in my life, and then headed back to Edinburgh. A lovely, cold, wet, day. –Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/11/24 - There have been numerous high scientific studies showing that LA has the best Korean food in America. I’ve gone to a couple of famous spots over the past year and aggregated these reviews to share with you all. If you read my other blogs, you would probably notice that I blog about food a lot. The truth is, I derive a lot of joy from going off campus for food adventures, so these are the highlights of my week that I want to share. If you are interested in hearing about other aspects of my life at Caltech, let me know. Also, I get asked this a lot in real life – No, I am no a Yelp Elite. I do not write any reviews on Yelp at all. I just read other people’s reviews to make my bucket list restaurants. Moving on… the best place I’ve visited is Majordomo in the Arts District. If you watch any food documentaries on Netflix, you probably would know of celebrity chef David Chang. Majordomo is his first venture in LA and it is a mega hit. I was on the waitlist for a good month to get a reservation for dinner at a reasonable hour. Is it worth the hype? I think so! I was starving when I got there, which may have biased my palate, but I am a huge fan of Asian fusion, and everything on the menu was up my alley. Some must haves are the bing. We got the bing with ham and spicy pineapple and it was delicious. I heard the one with egg and roe is also fantastic. As for larger dishes, we got the fried skate rice. I would highly recommend it. If I had more people in my dinner party, I would get the massive beef ribs with fondue.  For more homestyle cooking, I went to Myung Dong Koyja. It has the best cold noodles and dumplings. I know the concept of cold noodles sounds weird, but they freeze the broth which becomes like a shaved ice texture in the bowl. The noodles are super springy since there’s no hot broth to soften it. The texture is where it’s at. The dumplings are also super plump and flavorful. We original got one plate of 10 to share amongst two people, but we had to double our order because it was so good.  Some K-Town classics are Sun Nong Dan, and Hangari Kalguksu. Sun Nong Dan has the most impressive beef ribs with cheese fondue. Each order is large enough to feed a family of four. Hangari Kalguksu is known for their knife cut noodles. You know it’s good when the carb is the best part of the dish. Also, both these places have over 1000 five star reviews on Yelp, so even if I don’t know what I am talking about, at least one of them would.  These are just a few of the places that I really enjoyed. Of course, there are plenty more to try. I heard Genwa has some of the best kbbq around town and Dae Bu Do has amazing seafood. If any of them are worth sharing, you can read about it in a follow up post. "

Take that with a grain of salt; I personally don’t believe that the holiday season starts until after Thanksgiving, regardless of what holiday (if you celebrate a holiday) in December. But the Edinburgh Christmas market did start last week, and so I had to go and visit. I joined along on a Singapore society trip but split off from them a bit early because my and I hadn’t had dinner before coming, so we had to go hunt that down. Actually, it was an entire winter social evening. We watched the Nightmare Before Christmas, ate a few snacks, enjoyed each other’s company, and all in all had a good old wholesome evening. The Christmas market was definitely the highlight though, hence why it gets its own post. It was by far the largest Christmas market I’ve ever been to, and it was honestly more reminiscent of a carnival than it was anything else. There were 70-foot-tall rides, other amusement park specialties, and any sort of European food you could imagine. The most impressive part to me was the lights – there were as many lights as a zoo lights event or something like that. Also, the funniest thing was that we walked past the carousel playing Fairytale of New York City (which we just heard in Belfast). That was a bit of a surreal moment, but it made everything feel like it had come full circle.  For dinner, we settled on Mac N’ Cheese. It was delicious, creamy, and warm – the last of which being especially important because it was sub-zero (Celsius, hahaha). I also sprung for some real hot chocolate, delicious, made from pure chocolate, and perfect for a cold evening like this. In—terms of other crazy things we were able to find at the market, we found lobster rolls (??), churros, and oodles of other things. Just like in Belfast, there were lots of cute little shops selling ornaments and other holiday-themed goodies. Unfortunately, though, there was one thing missing – an ice-skating rink! Edinburgh banned having an ice-skating rink just this year; apparently it was bad for the grass or something. Ice-skating has been a long-time tradition of mine at the holidays. Ever since I was little, I’ve been practically every year… And I can’t possibly break a tradition like that… but stay tuned until next week. Hasta la macaroni, – Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/11/23 - Every year, the Caltech Society of Women Engineers attends the National SWE conference to network with other SWE Chapters and to hustle for jobs. Last year, the event was in Minneapolis, and the year before in Austin. This time around, it’s in Anaheim which is much more convenient for us. Since it is much closer, we were able to send many more delegates to attend and miss fewer classes in the process of doing so. A relevant comparison to the SWE conference is Grace Hopper. Both aim to increase the concentration of women in technology. However, Grace Hopper is specific to computer science and computer engineering while SWE caters to all fields, chemical, mechanical and biological to name a few. They are similar in scale with about 10K attendees, and have massive career fairs. As such, they are both valuable opportunities. We left early Thursday morning and arrived at the conference venue around noon. The career fair opened at 2pm and we were able to get in right away. This first day is quite hectic as most people are trying to throw their resumes at recruiters to get interviews. When booths get busy, it may take 15-30 minutes to even talk to someone. I ended up speaking to some graduate schools about their programs. A lot of schools will have fee waivers for prospective candidates. Considering that application fees are upwards of $150, these fee waivers are the best swag you can get. Another highlight for the conference is the keynote and workshops. A couple of SWE members went to one about engagement for your club and found it extremely helpful. One of the difficult parts about hosting SWE events on campus is that there are so many other clubs with their fun events with free food that it becomes difficult to attract attendees. It’s even more of a challenge to incorporate the club’s goals of professional development and outreach within these events. Regardless, the workshop taught us a lot about how we can run SWE at Caltech. Some of our other club members got even more out of the event – they came back with multiple job offers from the conference. Their success is a testament to the value of this event. There’s no doubt that Caltech SWE will attend the national conference in years to come. However, there is room for improvement. One of the most simple changes we can make to our itinerary is incorporating more group dinners and activities to help with team building. Hopefully, this can make the conference even more worthwhile for SWE attendees. "

    "body": "2019/11/19 - One of my favorite Northern Irish poets, Ciaran Carson, passed away last month, and this second part of the trip, this post title, and my Belfast exploration was completely inspired by him. Prior to taking Irish literature last year, I’d never really considered going to Ireland at all, much less that in the span of a month and a half I would be in both Belfast and in Dublin. And now, a full year later, I’ve been to both and am still floating the possibility of a trip to Galway. Crazy how life changes like that. Anyways what we did after the tour of the Giant’s Causeway. I’ll be honest, we were exhausted the next day, so we got a slow start. And by slow start, I mean that we woke up and went out for brunch. We found one of (apparently) the best cafes in Ireland, and I got bubble and squeak cakes, a British potato and cabbage cake that paired delightfully with a thick chunk of sausage on top. After this we headed to Crumlin Road Gaol, the famous prison in Belfast. It still held prisoners until 1996, so the history of the building was all too real, and many of the former prisoners had even come back to take the same tour we were on. It was simply a haunting building, with a fascinating history from the troubles, but also in the time before that.  Following the mildly spooky tour, we headed out to the botanic gardens and the Ulster Museum to learn even more about the history of Northern Ireland (and to relax in some warm greenhouses). And then we went to the Christmas market! There isn’t thanksgiving in the UK, so Christmas just starts whenever Halloween ends. Their Christmas market in Belfast was one of the cutest one’s I’ve ever been to though. It somehow felt homely and authentic, which is a wild spin on the world of American Christmas markets.  During the trip we also had the opportunity to listen to a large amount of traditional Irish music, or, at least music played on traditional Irish instruments. It was a bit disconcerting to hear an entire room full of Northern Irish people singing along to “Sweet Home Alabama”, but I also got to hear the last two of my favorite Pogues songs played live, so I can’t complain all too much.

    "body": "2019/11/18 - Well good morning there! Today I’m writing about what I did last weekend (as per usual). And what I did… was go to Ireland! Again! Except this was a little different than the last trip as we went to Northern island, specifically Belfast and the surrounding area. Our main reason for doing this was to go and visit the Giant’s Causeway (or, at least my main reason), an exceedingly unique geological feature North of Belfast, where cooling lava bends cracked, forming what is now a series of beautiful angular columns, most of which are heptagonal or hexagonal in shape. To do this though, we ended up on a bus tour (as this was significantly easier than renting a car for the weekend) and made a few other stops as well. These included the Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge, a traditionally dodgy bridge built for salmon fishing, that, since restrictions on salmon fishing had been implemented had been taken over by the national trust and made into a (somewhat disappointing) short bridge to a small island. The surrounding area was beautiful though. We also stopped at a couple of castles and a few other locations, but honestly most of them weren’t all too noteworthy, so enjoy this picture of a sheep that was at one of the stops.  The Giant’s causeway though, was sublime. It was everything I could’ve asked for, although perhaps a bit colder than I’d hoped. One thing that the pictures don’t do justice to is how big the columns are. Each one was about a foot or so in width – prior to this I’d thought they were maybe inches wide instead. We got a couple hours to climb around on this geological playground. We had to make sure to take many pictures, as this was the true reason for our visit to Northern Ireland, and I did a bit of bubble tea brand ambassador work too (although I couldn’t find bubble tea the night we got in so the flask was filled with water).  And the final highlight of the Giant’s Causeway? Surprisingly, it was the sandwich we got at the café. It was shockingly simple, Irish bread, bangers, back bacon, and a fried egg. And it was one of the most delicious sandwiches I’ve ever had. For some reason the extreme loading of meat was simply sublime, and I don’t really know why but it probably makes the top ten sandwiches I’ve had in my life. Go to the Giant’s Causeway! (and order the sandwich), –Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/11/14 - It’s truly Autumn in Scotland now. It reached 0 degrees Celsius today, or 32 Fahrenheit for you yanks. They’re setting up the Christmas market downtown (as thanksgiving isn’t a thing here they just skip directly from Halloween to Christmas). Snow isn’t falling, but it does seem to be raining every other day. And it’s pleasant, quite pleasant. The rain turns Edinburgh into even more of a dramatic and beautiful city than usually is. I spent a gorgeous, proper fall day taking the train over to Durham for… you guessed it… a fencing match! It was actually a rather long rain ride, with the leaves just at the end of turning colors. We passed to Berwick (apparently a different place than North Berwick) and Newcastle Upon Tyne as well, but the end destination was the prettiest. I’m not going to go too much into detail about Durham now as I’m planning on going back in a couple of weeks. TLDR: there is a beautiful castle, a beautiful city, and traffic. Funny enough, Durham is the only place that I’ve run into traffic in my entire time in Scotland, much in contrast with Los Angeles where if you say the word “traffic” three times an accident happens on the 110 and everything is backed up past Chinatown.  The fencing salle (place for the tournament) in Durham was a bit in the middle of nowhere. But it had some beautiful trees. The photo above doesn’t actually do it justice, but it was one of the most gorgeous overlooks I’ve seen outside of a fencing area. It was a tough loss to the Durham team; we were short a few people and they were very much not, but it is what it is. The strangest thing that’s happened now that it’s Autumn is that it gets dark ridiculously early. Like 3 PM early. It’s a bit absurd, so really anything we’re doing after class these days occurs in the dark. It’s a bit wild and honestly is a major decrease in energy just because it’s hard to find motivation when it’s dark out.  Oh, and my injury in Nottingham last week caused an urgent safety reminder to be sent out by British fencing, so cheers to that. I still stand by saying an 800N glove wouldn’t have made a difference in where he hit me. Enjoy the fall, –Chandrew "

    "body": "2019/11/14 - G’day mates! Today I am writing from Edinburgh, but I just go back from Perth! Yep, that’s right: flights to Australia were reaaaally cheap this weekend so we just couldn’t resist a trip down under! It was great! We saw a koala, had a Tim Tam Slam, and… yeah… just kidding. We went to Perth, Scotland, haha. Which, I have to say, was actually a lot more fun than we expected. Perth is about an hour and a half northeast by train, so we just decided top pop up there Saturday morning for honestly, no reason in particular. In all fairness, tickets were cheap, and we didn’t really have much else to do, but still we didn’t really know much about Perth or have a clue what we’d do there. The city, however, was beautiful. Shockingly gorgeous. Although a lot of the leaves had fallen off, what remained was picturesque. The city was also located directly on a river, which added to its beauty immensely. Combined with a classic UK architecture style, it just all seemed like a cohesive, quaint, middle-sized town in Northern Scotland.  We started our day with an English breakfast: bangers, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, roast mushrooms, nice, brown bread, and back bacon (more of pan-fried ham than it is bacon). And, of course, we did this at a tea house, so we also had a wonderful earl grey tea to pair with it as well. It was a lovely way to start what was honestly a bit chilly of the day, of course, we haven’t reached the point of a Colorado chilly day yet, but it was quite cold.  Following our breakfast, we went on a hunt to buy a scone, which actually trned out to be a bit harder to find than we thought. We went to two coffee shops and two grocery stores before we found it. And why did we do this? So that we could have a scone, in Scone, at the stone of scone, of course. The stone of scone is a red sandstone used for the English coronation; the original is in London, but the home of it is in Scone, an area just a mile North of Perth. So, we went there, took some photos, found Excalibur, failed to pull Excalibur out of its fake rock, and then wandered our way back. It was a beautiful, scenic walk all along. A truly wonderful day. Catch yous later! –Chandrew "

    "body": "2018/01/11 - Man, 2019 feels like it was just yesterday. See, I’m hilarious, I promise. Happy new year y’all! It is 2020, and with that I figured it was time to chat about the great New Year’s Eve barbeque that I prepared with my best friend from home, Morgan. Actually there isn’t exactly too much too explain. Morgan was a bit sad that I’d missed what I’d generally consider to be my favorite holiday, the 4th of July, and we decided to make up for it by having a good ol’ fashioned charcoal grill-out. With the one caveat being that it was Denver in December, so it was absolutely frigid. We still managed to assemble all the essentials, a bunch of friends, burgers cheese, chilli, potato salad, chips, soda, and some nice music. And we all huddled around a space heater and enjoyed out turkey burgers. I decided to head out a bit early to catch some Zs and a Waffle House waffle. New Year’s day was a bit more of an adventure. I fenced in a tournament and ended up making top 8 in foil and top 16 in the other two weapons (all of these events with 40+ people). But it was also a bit bittersweet because my big brother left for Japan and so I didn’t get to spend that extra bit of family time with him.  I think next year is going to be pretty great. I’m going back to Tech, I’m fencing better than I ever have, and life is going to be good. I have a lot of goals for the next year, but the one that I’ll share with y’all is that I want to finish my book. For the last two years now I’ve been working on a wee collection of short stories. It’s written in a minimalist style a lot like Carver, my favorite author. Although I haven’t quite been able to replicate it completely, I like to think that I’ve been able to combine a lot of the styles I’ve read into something that’s truly excellent. But it still has to be finished and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have a bit of a ways to go on that. And that’s why in writing, on this blog, that I’m going to finish this book. And it’s going to be a dang good time. So cheers to that! Hopefully hindsight is 2020, –Chandrew "
