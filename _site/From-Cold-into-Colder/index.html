                <p>It is COLD here. I know I’ve said that before but hOh my goodness I almost froze to death on Saturday. Of course, this wasn’t helped by how I almost froze to death Friday night as well. But that was by personal choice. So, Friday, night before a fencing tournament (as it always is) I decided to do something rather bone-headed and so I found myself at the ice-skating rink for disco night. Ice-skating has long been a tradition of mine, and one that I skipped during last school year. I’m not a pro or anything, but I don’t fall over anymore, and I can somewhat skate backwards, and that’s usually good enough for any ice rink in California.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, though, the same doesn’t exactly hold for Edinburgh. IT seems that at least at disco night, about half the people there are hockey players. Including the little 7-year-old kids. Trust me, I almost got run over by a couple of them playing ice tag. The disco vibe was also a bit disappointing – more Edinburgh nightclub than early 2000s pop-radio (which was what we were all expecting). Either way though, the rink was amazing, the friends were amazing, and the ice skates were shockingly mediocre (in a good way) for rentals. I left without bruises or blisters, and ready to go for another round.</p>

<p>Only… the next round was about 4 hours away from when I got back, and it came in the form of a train to Largs. Now, where’s Largs you ask? Good question! A lot of British people wouldn’t know the answer either. Largs is a tiny town 2 hours west of Glasgow. I’ll grant you that it’s quite scenic. We saw a beautiful sunrise. But also, to see that, our train was beyond early (and actually, I missed the earliest train). Largs is also the site of the Scottish national training facility. A bit like the Olympic training center in Colorado, only Scottish and much smaller. The day of fencing was actually quite atrocious for me, but we found a lovely little ice cream shop. And we ended the evening with curry cheese chips, as any good fencing evening should.</p>

<p><img src="https://ug-admissions-caltech-blog-publish.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/images/2019/12/6a0105349b8251970b0240a4a5e7e6200c-800wi.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Largs was also my last really obscure UK city trip that I’m taking for fencing this year. So, it’s a bit bittersweet. As my college fencing career will come to an end when I’m back at Caltech, this really was my last ride and it’s a bit sad. But I couldn’t have asked for anyone else to spend this season with.</p>

<p>Largs, Largs, Pants on Fargs?</p>
