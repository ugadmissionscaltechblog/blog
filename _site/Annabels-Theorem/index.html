I am a sophomore from the San Francisco Bay Area (home of the Silicon Valley) pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace Engineering. On campus, I am a member of Ruddock House, Club Latino, Women Mentoring Women, a Caltech Y Rise Tutor, and an Admissions Ambassador. Off campus, I intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) researching and predicting ionospheric irregularities using machine-learning. During my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, watching movies with my friends, and reading personal-development books.</span>
