    description: "Hello, my name is Annabel Reyna Gomez! I am a sophomore from the San Francisco Bay Area 
    (home of the Silicon Valley) pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Aerospace 
    Engineering. On campus, I am a member of Ruddock House, Club Latino, Women Mentoring Women, a 
    Caltech Y Rise Tutor, and an Admissions Ambassador. Off campus, I intern at NASA’s Jet Propulsion 
    Laboratory (JPL) researching and predicting ionospheric irregularities using machine-learning. 
    During my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, watching movies with my friends, and reading 
    personal-development books."

    description: "I'm a senior from Denver, Colorado (the land of Patagonia jackets and 
    unpredictable weather). At Caltech I'm on the fencing team foil squad captain and SAAC 
    representative, a member of chemistry club and ultimate frisbee team, and the Fleming House 
    food committee representative. In my free time, I like to hike, write poetry, shoot photos, 
    and explore LA for trendy food."

    I'm president of our campus's QuestBridge chapter. Recently, I joined our school's robotics 
    and rocket teams. Outside of academics, I enjoy reading, hanging out with 
    family & friends, and experimenting with food."

    description: "I'm from Vancouver, BC where it rains over 200 days a year. At Caltech, 
    I serve on the excomm of the Caltech Y and Society of Women Engineers and play piano 
    with the chamber music program. When I'm not doing sets and lab work, I enjoy hiking, 
    shopping, cooking, drawing, and scouring the internet for items to add to her never-ending 
    bucket list."

    description: "I grew up in the Seattle area and moved to Southern California to attend 
    Pitzer College in Claremont (and for the sunshine!) I graduated with a B.A. in Anthropology, 
    inspired by my love of museums and material culture and studied abroad in the Amazon region 
    of Brazil. After interning at The Getty Foundation, I worked in museum education at Huntington 
    Library (just down the street from Caltech). Even though I come from a humanities background, 
    I am a Techer at heart who always wants to hear about what students are working on in the lab 
    so I can live vicariously through them."

    description: "Hi! I’m Rashi, a California girl who grew up in Pasadena, practically next door 
    to campus. I’m a junior majoring in Bioengineering and would typically be spending my days at 
    Caltech messing with the genome of E. coli in lab. On campus, I do synthetic bio research, 
    have dabbled in a bit of electrical engineering with the Racing team, am part of the Bollywood 
    dance team Caltech Dhamaka, and like to spend time exploring the area with friends!"

    last year), help out as a dean's tutor, wait house dinners, and swim. Outside of the more
