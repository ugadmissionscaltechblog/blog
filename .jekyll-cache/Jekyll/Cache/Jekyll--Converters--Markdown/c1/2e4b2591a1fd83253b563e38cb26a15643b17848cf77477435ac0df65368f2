I"ˆ<p>These past six months have been a whirlwind- from having to move out of Caltech housing in March within a weekâ€™s notice due to COVID-19, to starting the first term of my junior year, Iâ€™ve definitely experienced a lot of change. When I went home in March, it was to a completely new state-my family moved from Chino, CA to New Jersey in January (great timing, huh?). While I missed seeing my friends from home, it was fun to have the chance to explore a completely new place. The pandemic obviously limited what I could see and do, but I got to experience walks through nature and along rivers normally foreign to a SoCal native and had some time to focus on bioinformatics research for the lab I work with on campus.</p>

<p>In September, my parents and I took a road trip to see a bit more of the East Coast, stopping in Boston and Newport, RI. Bostonâ€™s cobblestone streets and brick brownstones hold a very quaint charm, and I think itâ€™s a place I could eventually see myself living one day. Newport was pretty much the New England sailing town of my dreams. I love (like, LOVE) being on boats, and itâ€™s been a long-time goal of mine to learn to sail! In Newport I got to board a real sail-powered boat for the first time, in the same waters where one of the worldâ€™s most famous sailing regattas (the Americaâ€™s Cup) takes place.</p>

<p>After six months of being cooped up inside, our small trip was a welcome way for me to say goodbye to the East Coast before I would be moving back to California for term.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m now living with a couple of fellow Techers at my fourth residence of the year in Redondo Beach, CA. Since settling into our place weâ€™ve spent most of our time in the kitchen trying out new recipes for meals and desserts.  Our house menu might include: garlic naan made from scratch (itâ€™s even better than at some restaurants Iâ€™ve been to), kimchi tofu dumplings, homemade Olive Garden copy-cat breadsticks, sourdough pizza, or lace cookies! Our sourdough starter (Michael BublÃ©) and our basil plant (taking name suggestions) are always ready to lend a hand.

<p>While I never would have imagined that this is what my 2020 would look like, Iâ€™m glad that itâ€™s involved some adventure. Term is now quickly picking up pace, and Iâ€™m looking forward to these next few months!</p>
