I"<p>It’s a familiar story told by a select few. I anticipated the first line to read, “We regret to inform you.” Instead, orange and silver confetti fluttered across my laptop screen. My acceptance filled me with joy and disbelief. After telling the good news to friends, family, and mentors, I realized how much I sacrificed for this outcome. The sum of all my opportunity costs–the weekends preparing for science competitions, late nights crossing fruit flies, and weeks tweaking my essays instead of having more typical teenage adventures–cashed in at this one point in time. My high school experience could’ve been different, but I don’t regret my choices. I had so much fun learning and researching that I wanted to, in earnest, do more of that in college.</p>
