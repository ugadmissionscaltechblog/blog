I"£<p>It was a farewell dinner today. The beginning of the end. Crazy to think in less than a week Iâ€™ll be back in Denver and this entire country hopping adventure will be completely over.</p>

<p>Justin and I went to the Balmoral Hotel. As a birthday gift Iâ€™d received a gift certificate for their restaurant, and there really wouldnâ€™t have been any better way to use it than taking my best lad out for dinner.</p>

<p>The Balmoralâ€™s restaurant is legitimately called â€œNumber Oneâ€. And itâ€™s frequently regarded as the best restaurant in Edinburgh (if not the best in Scotland). It has a Michelin Star, a tasting menu, and basically everything Iâ€™ve come to love about fine dining.</p>

<p>So letâ€™s talk menu. The amuse boucheâ€™s were a tasty pastry cup fish mousse, roe deer raw, and the most delicious â€œtruffle bombâ€ a rice shell filled with truffly goodness.</p>

<p>Course one was an oyster from nearby.</p>
