I"Ä<p>Itâ€™s truly Autumn in Scotland now. It reached 0 degrees Celsius today, or 32 Fahrenheit for you yanks. Theyâ€™re setting up the Christmas market downtown (as thanksgiving isnâ€™t a thing here they just skip directly from Halloween to Christmas). Snow isnâ€™t falling, but it does seem to be raining every other day. And itâ€™s pleasant, quite pleasant. The rain turns Edinburgh into even more of a dramatic and beautiful city than usually is.</p>
