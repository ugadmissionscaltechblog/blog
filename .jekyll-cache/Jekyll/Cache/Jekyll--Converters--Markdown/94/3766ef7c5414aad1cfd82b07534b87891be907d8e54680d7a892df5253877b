I"Ñ<p>There have been numerous high scientific studies showing that LA has the best Korean food in America. Iâ€™ve gone to a couple of famous spots over the past year and aggregated these reviews to share with you all. If you read my other blogs, you would probably notice that I blog about food a lot. The truth is, I derive a lot of joy from going off campus for food adventures, so these are the highlights of my week that I want to share. If you are interested in hearing about other aspects of my life at Caltech, let me know. Also, I get asked this a lot in real life â€“ No, I am no a Yelp Elite. I do not write any reviews on Yelp at all. I just read other peopleâ€™s reviews to make my bucket list restaurants.</p>
