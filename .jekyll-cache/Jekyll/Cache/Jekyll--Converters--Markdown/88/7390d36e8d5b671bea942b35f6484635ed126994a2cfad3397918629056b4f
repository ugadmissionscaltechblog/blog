I"”<p>It is COLD here. I know Iâ€™ve said that before but hOh my goodness I almost froze to death on Saturday. Of course, this wasnâ€™t helped by how I almost froze to death Friday night as well. But that was by personal choice. So, Friday, night before a fencing tournament (as it always is) I decided to do something rather bone-headed and so I found myself at the ice-skating rink for disco night. Ice-skating has long been a tradition of mine, and one that I skipped during last school year. Iâ€™m not a pro or anything, but I donâ€™t fall over anymore, and I can somewhat skate backwards, and thatâ€™s usually good enough for any ice rink in California.</p>
