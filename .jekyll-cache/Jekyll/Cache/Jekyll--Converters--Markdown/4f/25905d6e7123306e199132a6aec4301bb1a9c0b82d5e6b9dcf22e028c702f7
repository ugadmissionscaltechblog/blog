I"¨<p>Hello, Java monsters! If you couldnâ€™t tell from my EXCELLENT punning, Iâ€™m taking CS 2 this term, a computer science course about the wonderful world of Java. Thatâ€™s one of my new classes for this term. Also included: plate tectonics, seismology, field geophysics, physics lab, and a design-your-own English class about American minimalism as a prep-course for my thesis (which Iâ€™m hoping to start next term).</p>
