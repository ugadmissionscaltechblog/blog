I"	<p>Well, I’m back in Colorful Colorado! Although at this time of year, it’s not all to colorful. I have to say, it’s a bit weird being back. In Colorado, definitely, but more so just being in the US. I think the biggest shock for me was walking into the Safeway grocery store that’s about a half mile from my house. It’s… huge. I never really realized this until I was abroad but American stores in general are just massive. It was the first time I’d seen a butcher’s counter inside a store in who knows how long. Even at the giant FairPrice in Singapore I don’t remember seeing anything like that. FairPrice was more like a miniature target. And then the UK stores were all TINY compared to that. It’s just a strange and different model.</p>

<p>Anyways, that’s probably enough about grocery stores for now. I also went to the local Asian market and man oh man have I missed being surrounded by every sort of Asian food that I could physically ask to have.</p>

<p>I’m sure you’re probably wondering how it is adjusting in general though. First, Colorado is a lot warmer than Scotland. Not physically, actually it dropped about ten degrees colder within a couple days of me being back. But, there’s no humidity here. In-fact, it’s so dry that writing this a week after being back (and countless gallons of water) I am STILL dehydrated. This makes it feel infinitely less cold than Scotland does. There’s also no windchill and that helps too. Secondly, everyone here is… American. Everything is American. And that’s not a bad thing. There are big portion sizes of food. Soft drinks that don’t have artificial sweeteners.</p>

<p>Also, I’m ridiculously jetlagged. I have been for a week. It’s not awful, but I’ve been getting tired at 8PM and waking up around 7AM (very different from my typical 2AM-10AM sleep schedule). Either way it’s certainly nice being back. After half a year outside of the US it’s a bit refreshing to be back in a culture that’s familiar. And where I don’t constantly have to explain why I pronounce things all funny-like.</p>

<p>Finally, it snowed. I don’t like snow. It’s all wet and cold, and irritating. And it GETS EVERYWHERE!</p>
