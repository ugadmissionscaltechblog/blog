<p>I spent this Thanksgiving with one of my good friends in San Francisco. My friend is an Techer alum and she currently works in asset management. Since she did not have enough of a vacation to fly down to LA to spend the long weekend with her family, and since I was free, I went up to spend with her. Needless to say, it was a very untraditional Thanksgiving. We did not have any turkey or stuffing. Instead, we went out for sushi and brunch. One thing we did do is celebrate Black Friday.</p>

<p>I arrived in SF around Thursday evening, and headed out for dinner right away. We went to a sushi and karaoke bar located in inner Richmond. My friend said that the restaurant is usually quite packed. However, since most people are spending Thanksgiving at home with their families, we were one of the two tables that night. We ordered, sashimi, rolls, appetizers and plenty of matcha cream puffs. Even though the food was not that heavy, we still over ate and went home in a food coma.</p>

<p>The next morning, we got up early for yoga at the Equinox in Marina. My friend is a member and raves about the quality of facilities. I must admit that it does not disappoint. Their showers have Kiehls branded everything, and there is an unlimited supply of clean towels. After yoga, we headed to this cute brunch spot called U Dessert Story and Vintage brunch near Fillmore. We ordered the omelette rice and a matcha lava cake to split. It was absolutely delicious.</p>

<p>We spent the rest of the afternoon exploring Chrissy field, a grassy area with a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge, and Ocean Beach. At one point, it started raining, but the showers quickly subsided so we did not have to drastically change our plans. The highlight of that evening was catching the sunset at Ocean Beach. The beach has such a large field of view that it felt like the end of the Earth.</p>

<p>On Saturday, it just poured. We got brunch at Jane on Fillmore and had dinner at the Italian Homemade Company. We spent the rest of the day shopping and watching movies indoors. Although it was not that eventful, it was nice to take a break.</p>

<p>Finally, Thanksgiving break is a trap. When I got back to campus on Sunday, I realized how behind I was on work. Luckily, Iâ€™ve been able to get back on track, so the vacation/procrastination was worthwhile.</p>
