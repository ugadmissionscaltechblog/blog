I"¤<p>Well. Iâ€™m on a flight out of the UK right now. Iâ€™m going from London to Iceland, and then heading back home to Denver for a couple weeks.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t do much in London; I had a very specific agenda and didnâ€™t have a lot of time leftover for anything else. I really only had one day there, and spent most of it getting to and exploring the Royal Botanic Gardens, or Kew Gardens as itâ€™s often called. The gardens were everything I couldâ€™ve ever wanted. Tranquil greenhouses, a huge, expansive arboretum. And, my personal favorite: not one, but TWO rooms entirely dedicated to carnivorous plants. And the bonus, it was a bit dreary that day, so the entire grounds were deserted. A tranquil and perfect way to spend my last day in the UK. But, of course, I didnâ€™t stop there. Justin, David, and I all went out for a spot of tea and ended the day by seeing Les MisÃ©rables, the last of my favorite musicals that I hadnâ€™t seen live. Les Mis was excellent. Honestly one of the best theater performances Iâ€™ve ever seen. I had chills during the entire performance and the singing was so good that it made me seriously doubt the credentials of whoever cast the movie.</p>
