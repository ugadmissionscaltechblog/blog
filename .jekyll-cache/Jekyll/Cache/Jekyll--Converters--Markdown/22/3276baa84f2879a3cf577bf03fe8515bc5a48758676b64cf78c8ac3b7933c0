I"î<p>Man, 2019 feels like it was just yesterday.</p>

<p>See, Iâ€™m hilarious, I promise.</p>

<p>Happy new year yâ€™all! It is 2020, and with that I figured it was time to chat about the great New Yearâ€™s Eve barbeque that I prepared with my best friend from home, Morgan. Actually there isnâ€™t exactly too much too explain. Morgan was a bit sad that Iâ€™d missed what Iâ€™d generally consider to be my favorite holiday, the 4th of July, and we decided to make up for it by having a good olâ€™ fashioned charcoal grill-out. With the one caveat being that it was Denver in December, so it was absolutely frigid. We still managed to assemble all the essentials, a bunch of friends, burgers cheese, chilli, potato salad, chips, soda, and some nice music. And we all huddled around a space heater and enjoyed out turkey burgers. I decided to head out a bit early to catch some Zs and a Waffle House waffle.</p>

<p>New Yearâ€™s day was a bit more of an adventure. I fenced in a tournament and ended up making top 8 in foil and top 16 in the other two weapons (all of these events with 40+ people). But it was also a bit bittersweet because my big brother left for Japan and so I didnâ€™t get to spend that extra bit of family time with him.</p>

<p>I think next year is going to be pretty great. Iâ€™m going back to Tech, Iâ€™m fencing better than I ever have, and life is going to be good. I have a lot of goals for the next year, but the one that Iâ€™ll share with yâ€™all is that I want to finish my book. For the last two years now Iâ€™ve been working on a wee collection of short stories. Itâ€™s written in a minimalist style a lot like Carver, my favorite author. Although I havenâ€™t quite been able to replicate it completely, I like to think that Iâ€™ve been able to combine a lot of the styles Iâ€™ve read into something thatâ€™s truly excellent. But it still has to be finished and Iâ€™d be lying if I said I didnâ€™t have a bit of a ways to go on that. And thatâ€™s why in writing, on this blog, that Iâ€™m going to finish this book. And itâ€™s going to be a dang good time. So cheers to that!</p>

<p>Hopefully hindsight is 2020,</p>
