I"›	<p>After a week being back, I think itâ€™s about time for some reflections on what it meant to be abroad, and what Iâ€™ve taken away from it. Iâ€™m really happy to be back, but itâ€™s just been almost a culture shock of sorts being back in California, and back at my true home (for now, at least).</p>

<p>Of course, my parents wouldnâ€™t say that Caltech is my home, but I think that may be one of the first things I realized when I was abroad; when people ask me where Iâ€™m from Iâ€™d always say that I was born in Denver and I live in Los Angeles. In a lot of ways, bit by bit, Iâ€™ve become more and more of a Los Angeles convert. Still a Colorado native at heart, but a Los Angeles native. I really do love Los Angeles. When I stepped off the plane in Burbank flying in I remembered a bit of that. The rolling hills, warm air, and palm trees. It is its own kind of magic.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be honest, I miss Singapore. I miss waking up knowing that one of the best roast duck plates Iâ€™ve ever had is a 2-minute walk and $3 away. I miss fencing in the suffocating humidity, and even taking the bus to work every single morning. Singapore in a lot of ways felt like a place I truly belonged, an Asian country with a huge British influence, just like how Iâ€™m an Asian person with a large amount of American influence.</p>

<p>I miss Scotland too, but a little bit less so. I donâ€™t think I connected to Scotland quite as much as I did to Singapore. It was scold, for one, and as Iâ€™m sure yâ€™all readers have figured out, I canâ€™t really deal with cold weather. I really do miss all my friends though. I miss the late evenings out with Justin, the lack of homework, the constant, nonstop travelling. It was a great time being abroad, and it feels almost wrong to be stagnant in one location for the rest of the year.</p>

<p>And my takeaway from all of this is that I can find those same things back here at Tech too. I can take a weekend and go down to San Diego or camping in the mountains. I can hunt for that cheap and delicious roast duck.</p>

<p>So thatâ€™s my takeaway. Life doesnâ€™t need to change, but instead expand from all of the experiences that you live through. Take those same life lessons and apply them to your daily life.</p>

<p>Think deep and learn,</p>
