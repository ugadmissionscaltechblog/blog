I"`<p>Happy Friday y’all! In all my abundant free time (which <em>obviously</em> exists) I’ve started volunteering with the Pasadena Unified School District. I’ve been working assisting their after-school program LEARNS, specifically helping with the Chemistry Olympiad and also running experiments for the kids to keep them engaged in science.</p>
