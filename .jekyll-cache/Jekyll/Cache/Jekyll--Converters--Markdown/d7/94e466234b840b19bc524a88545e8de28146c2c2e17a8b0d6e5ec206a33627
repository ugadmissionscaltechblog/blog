I"û<p>Well, Iâ€™m back in Colorful Colorado! Although at this time of year, itâ€™s not all to colorful. I have to say, itâ€™s a bit weird being back. In Colorado, definitely, but more so just being in the US. I think the biggest shock for me was walking into the Safeway grocery store thatâ€™s about a half mile from my house. Itâ€™sâ€¦ huge. I never really realized this until I was abroad but American stores in general are just massive. It was the first time Iâ€™d seen a butcherâ€™s counter inside a store in who knows how long. Even at the giant FairPrice in Singapore I donâ€™t remember seeing anything like that. FairPrice was more like a miniature target. And then the UK stores were all TINY compared to that. Itâ€™s just a strange and different model.</p>
